thallium is found in the minerals  crookesite  tlcu7se4  hutchinsonite  tlpbas5s9 and  lorandite  tlass2 it also occurs as trace in  pyrites  and extracted as a byproduct of roasting this ore for sulfuric acid production the metal can be obtained from the  smelting  of lead and zinc rich ores  manganese nodules  found on the  ocean floor  also contain thallium but nodule extraction is prohibitively expensive and potentially environmentally destructive in addition several other thallium minerals containing 16 to 60 thallium occur in nature as sulfide or selenide complexes with  antimony   arsenic  copper lead and  silver  but are rare and have no commercial importance as sources of this element see also  categorythallium minerals
========

thallium has 25  isotopes  which have  atomic masses  that range from 184 to 210 203tl and 205tl are the only stable isotopes and 204tl is the most stable  radioisotope  with a  halflife  of 378 years
========
thallium202 half life 1223 days can be made in a cyclotron while thallium204 half life 378 years is made by the  neutron activation  of stable thallium in a  nuclear reactor
========

thallium and its compounds are very toxic and should be handled with great care   contact with skin is dangerous and adequate ventilation should be provided when melting this metal   thalliumi compounds have a high aqueous  solubility  and are readily absorbed through the skin exposure to them should not exceed 01  mg  per  m  of skin in an 8hour timeweighted average 40hour work week thallium is a suspected human  carcinogen
========
part of the reason for thalliums high toxicity is that when present in aqueous solution as the univalent thalliumi ion tl it exhibits some similarities with essential  alkali metal  cations particularly  potassium  as the atomic radius is almost identical it can thus enter the body via potassium uptake pathways however other aspects of thalliums chemistry are very different from that of the alkali metals  eg its high affinity for  sulfur  ligands due to the presence of empty dorbitals and so this substitution disrupts many cellular processes for instance thallium may attack sulphurcontaining proteins such as  cysteine  residues and  ferredoxins
========
thalliums toxicity has led to its use now discontinued in many countries as a  rat  and  ant  poison
========
among the distinctive effects of thallium poisoning are  loss of hair  which led it to its initial use as a  depilatory  before its toxicity was properly appreciated and damage to peripheral nerves victims may experience a sensation of walking on hot coals thallium was once an effective murder weapon before its effects became understood and an antidote  prussian blue  discovered
========
one of the main methods of removing thallium both radioactive and normal from humans is to use  prussian blue  which is a solid  ion exchange  material which absorbs thallium and releases  potassium  the prussian blue is fed by mouth to the person and it passes through their digestive system and comes out in the  stool
========
 the  cia  is believed by its inspector general to have conceived a scheme to poison  fidel castro  by exposure to thallium salts placed in his shoes while they were being polished  the goal was to discredit him by causing him to lose his characteristic hair and beard the scheme progressed as far as testing on animals but the trip during which the poison was to be administered fell through
========
 in 1953  australian   caroline grills  was sentenced to life in prison after three family members and a close family friend died authorities found thallium in tea that she had given to two additional family members
========
 it is claimed that  south african  agents once plotted to use it against  nelson mandela  while he was in prison on  robben island  the  truth and reconciliation commission  heard how agents established plans to add doses of the chemical to his medication
========
 thallium is one of the poisons that  graham frederick young  used on his victims
========
 in 1988 members of the carr family from central florida fell ill from what appeared to be thallium poisoning  peggy carr the mother died slowly and painfully from the poison and her son and stepson were critically ill but recovered  peggys husband was initially a suspect until thallium was discovered in his system two years later the carrs neighbor  george j trepal  a chemist and member of  mensa  was convicted of murdering mrs carr and attempting to murder her family the thallium was found to be slipped into bottles of cocacola at mrs carrs house and trepal was sentenced to die in the electric chair
========

 in june 2004 25 russian soldiers earned honorable mention  darwin awards  after becoming ill from thallium exposure when they found a can of mysterious white powder in a rubbish dump on their base at  khabarovsk  in the russian far east oblivious to the danger of misusing an unidentified white powder from a military dump site the conscripts added it to tobacco and used it as a substitute for  talcum powder  on their feet
========
 in 2005 a 17 year old girl in  numazu   shizuoka   japan  admitted to attempting to murder her mother by lacing her tea with thallium causing a national scandal
========
 in february of 2007 two americans  marina and yana kovalevsky  a mother and daughter visiting russia were hospitalized due to thallium poisoning  both had emigrated from the soviet union to the united states in 1989 and had made several trips to russia since then
========
  agatha christie  who worked as a  pharmacist  used thallium as the agent of murder in her  detective fiction  novel  the pale horse  mdash the first clue to the murder method coming from the hair loss of the victims
========
 in  nigel williams  1990 novel  the wimbledon poisoner  henry far uses thallium to  baste  a roast chicken in a failed attempt to murder his wife
========
 concentrated thallium is used as the poison of choice of the wyoming widow in the 2006 comedy  big nothing
