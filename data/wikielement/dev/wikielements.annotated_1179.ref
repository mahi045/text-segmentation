the  discovery  of the element is credited to the german chemist  martin heinrich klaproth  while he was working in his experimental laboratory in  berlin  in 1789 klaproth was able to precipitate a yellow compound likely  sodium diuranate  by dissolving pitchblende in  nitric acid  and neutralizing the solution with  sodium hydroxide  klaproth mistakenly assumed the yellow substance was the oxide of a yetundiscovered element and heated it with  charcoal  to obtain a black powder which he thought was the newly discovered metal itself in fact that powder was an oxide of uranium he named the newly discovered element after the planet  uranus  which had been discovered eight years earlier by  william herschel
