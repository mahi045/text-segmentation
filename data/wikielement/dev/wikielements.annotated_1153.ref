tellurium is in the same series as  sulfur  and  selenium  and forms similar compounds a compound with metal or hydrogen and similar ions is called a  telluride   gold  and  silver  tellurides are considered good ores  compounds with tellurate ions complexes teo42 or teo66 are known as  tellurates   also  tellurites  teo32  also tellurols teh named with prefix tellanyl or suffix tellurol
see also  categorytellurium compounds
========

there are 30 known  isotopes  of tellurium with  atomic masses  that range from 108 to 137 naturally found tellurium consists of eight isotopes listed in the table to the right three of them are observed to be radioactive 128te has the longest known halflife 22times1024 years among all radioactive isotopes
========
tellurium and tellurium compounds should be considered to be mildly  toxic  and need to be handled with care
========
acute poisoning is rare
tellurium is not reported to be carcinogenic
========
humans exposed to as little as 001 mgm3 or less in air develop tellurium breath which has a  garlic like odor
the garlic odor that is associated with human intake of tellurium compounds is caused from the tellurium being metabolized by the body when the body metabolizes tellurium in any oxidation state the tellurium gets converted into  dimethyl telluride  dimethyl telluride is volatile and produces the garliclike smell

thorium    is a  chemical element  with the symbol th and  atomic number  90 as a naturally occurring slightly radioactive metal it has been considered as an alternative nuclear fuel to  uranium
========
when pure thorium is a silvery white metal that retains its luster for several months however when it is exposed to oxygen thorium slowly tarnishes in air becoming grey and eventually black  thorium dioxide  tho2 also called thoria has the highest melting point of any oxide 3300c when heated in air thorium metal  turnings  ignite and burn brilliantly with a white light
========
thorium has the largest liquid range of any element 2946 k between the melting point and boiling point
========
see  actinides in the environment  for details of the environmental aspects of thorium
========
applications of thorium
========
 as an  alloying  element in  magnesium  used in aircraft engines imparting high  strength  and  creep  resistance at elevated temperatures
 thorium is used to coat  tungsten  wire used in electronic equipment improving the  electron   emission  of heated  cathodes
 thorium has been used in  gas tungsten arc welding  electrodes and  heatresistant   ceramics
  uraniumthorium age dating  has been used to date hominid  fossils
 as a  fertile material  for producing  nuclear fuel  in particular the proposed  energy amplifier  reactor design would employ thorium  since thorium is more abundant than uranium some  nuclear reactor  designs incorporate thorium in their  fuel cycle
 thorium is a very effective  radiation shield  although it has not been used for this purpose as much as  lead  or  depleted uranium
 thorium may be used in  nuclear reactors  instead of uranium as fuel this produces less  transuranic waste
========
applications of  thorium dioxide  tho2
========
  mantles  in portable gas lights these mantles glow with a dazzling light unrelated to radioactivity when heated in a gas flame
 used to control the grain size of  tungsten  used for electric lamps
 used for hightemperature laboratory  crucibles
 added to  glass  it helps create glasses of a high  refractive index  and with low  dispersion  consequently they find application in highquality  lenses  for cameras and scientific instruments
 has been used as a  catalyst
 in the conversion of  ammonia  to  nitric acid
 in  petroleum   cracking
 in producing  sulfuric acid
 thorium dioxide is the active ingredient of  thorotrast  which was used as part of  xray  diagnostics this use has been abandoned due to the  carcinogenic  nature of thorotrast
