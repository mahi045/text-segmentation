technetium99 is the most common and most readily available isotope as it is a major product of the fission of uranium235  one gram of 99tc produces 62108 disintegrations a second that is 062 g bq g
========
technetium and  promethium  are unusual light elements in that they have no stable isotopes the reason for this is somewhat complicated
========
using the  liquid drop model  for atomic nuclei one can derive a semiempirical formula for the binding energy of a nucleus this formula predicts a valley of beta stability along which  nuclides  do not undergo beta decay  nuclides that lie up the walls of the valley tend to decay by beta decay towards the center by emitting an electron emitting a  positron  or capturing an electron
========
for a fixed odd number of nucleons a the graph of binding energies vs  atomic number  number of protons is shaped like a  parabola  ushaped with the most stable nuclide at the bottom a single beta decay or electron captures then transforms one nuclide of mass a into the next or preceding one if the product has a lower binding energy and the difference in energy is sufficient to drive the decay mode when there is only one parabola there can be only one stable isotope lying on that parabola

for a fixed even number of nucleons a the graph is jagged and is better visualized as two separate  parabolas  for even and odd atomic numbers because isotopes with an even number of protons and an even number of neutrons are more stable than isotopes with an odd number of neutrons and an odd number of protons
========
when there are two parabolas that is when the number of  nucleons  is even it can happen rarely that there is a stable nucleus with an odd number of neutrons and an odd number of protons although there are only 4 truly stable examples as opposed to very longlived the light nuclei 2h 6li 10b 14n  however if this happens there can be no stable isotope with an even number of neutrons and an even number of protons
========
for technetium z43 the valley of beta stability is centered at around 98 nucleons  however for every number of nucleons from 95 to 102 there is already at least one stable nuclide of either molybdenum z42 or ruthenium z44    for the isotopes with odd numbers of nucleons this immediately rules out a stable isotope of technetium since there can be only one stable nuclide with a fixed odd number of nucleons  for the isotopes with an even number of nucleons since technetium has an odd number of protons any isotope must also have an odd number of neutrons  in such a case the presence of a stable nuclide having the same number of nucleons and an even number of protons rules out the possibility of a stable nucleus

tin is a  chemical element  with the symbol sn    and  atomic number  50 this silvery malleable  poor metal  that is not easily  oxidized  in air and resists  corrosion  is found in many  alloys  and is used to coat other metals to prevent corrosion tin is obtained chiefly from the  mineral   cassiterite  where it occurs as an  oxide  it can be  alloyed  with  copper  to make  bronze
========
tin is a malleable ductile highly  crystalline  silverywhite  metal  when a bar of tin is bent a strange crackling sound known as the  tin cry  can be heard due to the breaking of the crystals this metal resists corrosion from  distilled  sea and soft  tap water  but can be attacked by strong  acids   alkalis  and by  acid salts  tin acts as a  catalyst  when  oxygen  is in solution and helps accelerate chemical attack
tin forms the dioxide sno2 when it is heated in the presence of  air  sno2 in turn is feebly acidic and forms stannate sno32 salts with  basic oxides  tin can be highly polished and is used as a protective coat for other metals in order to prevent corrosion or other chemical action this metal combines directly with  chlorine  and oxygen and displaces  hydrogen  from dilute acids tin is malleable at ordinary temperatures but is brittle when it is heated
========
tins chemical properties fall between those of metals and nonmetals just as the semiconductors  silicon  and  germanium  do tin has two  allotropes  at normal pressure and temperature gray tin and white tin

below 132  c  it exists as gray or alpha tin which has a cubic  crystal structure  similar to  silicon  and  germanium  gray tin has no metallic properties at all is a dullgray powdery material and has few uses other than a few specialized  semiconductor  applications

when warmed above 132 c tin changes into white or beta tin which is metallic and has a tetragonal structure converting gray tin powder into white tin produces white tin powder to convert powdery gray tin into solid white tin the temperature must be raised above the melting point of tin

gray tin can cause undesirable effects in applications where the metallic properties of tin are important since metallic white tin will slowly convert to gray tin if it is held for a long time below 132 c the metallic surface of white tin becomes covered with a gray powder which is easily rubbed off the gray patches slowly expand until all of the tin in the object is converted from the metal to the powder at which point it loses its structural integrity and may fall to pieces this process is known as tin disease or  tin pest  tin pest was a particular problem in northern  europe  in the 18th century as  organ pipes  made of tin would sometimes completely disintegrate during long cold winters   some sources also say that during  napoleon s russian campaign of 1812 the temperatures became so cold that the tin buttons on the soldiers uniforms disintegrated contributing to the defeat of the grande arm√©e however the veracity of this story is debatable because napoleon would likely have foreseen this problem and the transformation to gray tin often takes a reasonably long time this transformation however may be prevented by the addition of  antimony  or  bismuth
========
tin bonds readily to  iron  and has been used for coating  lead  or zinc and  steel  to prevent  corrosion  tinplated  steel  containers are widely used for  food preservation  and this forms a large part of the market for metallic tin speakers of british english call them tins americans call them  cans  or tin cans one thusderived use of the slang term  tinnie  or tinny means can of beer the  tin whistle  is so called because it was first massproduced in tinplated steel
========
other uses
some important tin  alloys  are  bronze   bell metal   babbitt metal   die casting  alloy  pewter   phosphor bronze  soft  solder  and  white metal
the most important salt formed is  stannous chloride  which has found use as a reducing agent and as a  mordant  in the calico printing process electrically conductive coatings are produced when tin salts are sprayed onto  glass  these coatings have been used in panel lighting and in the production of frostfree  windshields
most metal pipes in a  pipe organ  are made of varying amounts of a tinlead alloy with 5050 being the most common the amount of tin in the pipe defines the pipes tone since tin is the most tonally resonant of all metals  when a tinlead alloy cools the lead cools slightly faster and makes a mottled or spotted effect this metal alloy is referred to as spotted metal
window glass is most often made via floating molten  glass  on top of molten tin creating  float glass  in order to make a flat surface this is called the  pilkington process
tin is also used in  solders  for joining  pipes  or  electric circuits  in  bearing  alloys in glassmaking and in a wide range of tin chemical applications  although of higher melting point than a  lead tin alloy the use of pure tin or tin alloyed with other metals in these applications is rapidly supplanting the use of the previously common leadndashcontaining alloys in order to eliminate the problems of toxicity caused by lead
tin foil was once a common wrapping material for foods and drugs replaced in the early 20th century by the use of  aluminium foil  which is now commonly referred to as tin foil hence one use of the slang term  tinnie  or tinny for a small retail package of a drug such as  cannabis  or for a can of beer
========
tin becomes a  superconductor  below 372  k  in fact tin was one of the first superconductors to be studied the  meissner effect  one of the characteristic features of superconductors was first discovered in superconducting tin crystals the  niobium tin compound  nbsub3subsn  is commercially used as wires for  superconducting magnets  due to the materials high  critical temperature  18 k and critical magnetic     field 25  t  a superconducting magnet weighing only a couple of  kilograms  is capable of producing magnetic fields comparable to a conventional  electromagnet  weighing tons
