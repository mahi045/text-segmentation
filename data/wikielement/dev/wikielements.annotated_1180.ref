in 1841  eugènemelchior péligot  who was professor of analytical chemistry at the  conservatoire national des arts et métiers  central school of arts and manufactures in  paris  isolated the first sample of uranium metal by heating  uranium tetrachloride  with  potassium
========
 antoine henri becquerel  discovered  radioactivity  by using uranium in 1896
========

a team led by  enrico fermi  in 1934 observed that bombarding uranium with  neutrons  produces the emission of  beta rays   electrons  or  positrons  see  beta particle  the experiments leading to the discovery of uraniums ability to  fission  break apart into lighter elements and release  binding energy  were conducted by  otto hahn  and  fritz strassmann  in hahns laboratory in berlin  lise meitner  and her nephew physicist  otto robert frisch  published the physical explanation in february 1939 and named the process  nuclear fission  soon after fermi hypothesized that the fission of uranium might release enough neutrons to sustain a fission reaction confirmation of this hypothesis came in 1939 and later work found that on average about 2 12 neutrons are released by each fission of the rare uranium isotope  uranium235
========
on  2 december   1942  another team led by enrico fermi was able to initiate the first artificial  nuclear chain reaction   chicago pile1  working in a lab below the stands of  stagg field  at the  university of chicago  the team created the conditions needed for such a reaction by piling together 400nbsptons 360nbsptonnes of  graphite  58nbsptons 53nbsptonnes of  uranium oxide  and six tons five and a half tonnes of uranium metal

two major types of atomic bomb were developed in the  manhattan project  during  world war ii  a  plutonium based device see  trinity test  and  fat man  whose plutonium was derived from uranium238 and a uraniumbased device nicknamed  little boy  whose fissile material was highly  enriched uranium  the uraniumbased little boy device became the first nuclear weapon used in war when it was detonated over the  japanese  city of  hiroshima  on  6 august   1945  exploding with a yield equivalent to 12500nbsptonnes of  tnt  the blast and thermal wave of the bomb destroyed nearly 50000 buildings and killed approximately 75000 people see  atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki

 experimental breeder reactor i  at the  idaho national laboratoryinl  near  arco idaho  became the first functioning artificial nuclear reactor on  20 december   1951  initially four 150watt light bulbs were lit by the reactor but improvements eventually enabled it to power the whole facility later the whole town of arco became the first in the world to have all its  electricity  come from nuclear power the worlds first commercial scale nuclear power station  obninsk  in the  soviet union  began generation with its reactor am1 on  27 june   1954  other early nuclear power plants were  calder hall  in  england  which began generation on  17 october   1956  and the  shippingport atomic power station  in  pennsylvania  which began on  26 may   1958  nuclear power was used for the first time for propulsion by a  submarine  the  uss nautilus  in 1954

fifteen ancient and no longer active  natural nuclear fission reactors  were found in three separate ore deposits at the  oklo  mine in  gabon   west africa  in 1972 discovered by french physicist  francis perrin  they are collectively known as the  oklo fossil reactors  the ore they exist in is 17 billion years old at that time uranium235 constituted about three percent of the total uranium on earth this is high enough to permit a sustained nuclear fission chain reaction to occur providing other conditions are right the ability of the surrounding sediment to contain the  nuclear waste  products in less than ideal conditions has been cited by the us federal government as evidence of their claim that the  yucca mountain  facility could safely be a repository of waste for the  nuclear power  industry

during the  cold war  between the soviet union and the united states huge stockpiles of uranium were amassed and tens of thousands of nuclear weapons were created using enriched uranium and plutonium made from uranium
========
since the  breakup of the soviet union  in 1991 an estimated 600nbsptons 540nbsptonnes of highlyenriched weapons grade uranium enough to make 40000 nuclear warheads have been stored in often inadequately guarded facilities in the  russian federation  and several other former soviet states
========
aboveground  nuclear tests  by the soviet union and the united states in the 1950s and early 1960s and by  france  into the 1970s and 1980s additional fallout and pollution occurred from several  nuclear accidents
========
the  windscale fire  at the  sellafield  nuclear plant in 1957 spread  iodine131  a short lived radioactive isotope over much of  northern england
========
the  three mile island accident  in 1979 released a small amount of  iodine131   the amounts released by the partial meltdown of the three mile island power plant were minimal and an environmental survey only found trace amounts in a few field mice dwelling nearby  as i131 has a half life of slightly more than eight days any danger posed by the radioactive material has long since passed for both of these incidents
========
the  chernobyl disaster  in 1986 however was a complete core breach meltdown and partial detonation of the reactor which ejected iodine131 and  strontium90  over a large area of europe  the 28 year halflife of strontium90 means that only recently has some of the surrounding countryside around the reactor been deemed safe enough to be habitable

uranium is a  naturally occurring  element that can be found in low levels within all rock soil and water uranium is also the highestnumbered element to be found naturally in significant quantities on earth and is always found combined with other elements the decay of uranium  thorium  and  potassium40  in the earths  mantle  is thought to be the main source of heat that keeps the  outer core  liquid and drives  mantle convection  which in turn drives  plate tectonics
========
its average concentration in the  earth s  crust  is depending on the reference 2 to 4 parts per million
========
it is more plentiful than  antimony   tin   cadmium   mercury  or silver and it is about as abundant as  arsenic  or  molybdenum
========

========
some organisms such as the lichen  trapelia involuta  or  microorganisms  such as the  bacterium   citrobacter  can absorb concentrations of uranium that are up to 300 times higher than in their environment citrobacter species absorb  uranyl  ions when given  glycerol phosphate  or other similar organic phosphates after one day one gram of bacteria will encrust themselves with nine grams of uranyl phosphate crystals this creates the possibility that these organisms could be used in  bioremediation  to  decontaminate  uraniumpolluted water
========
 plants  absorb some uranium from the soil they are rooted in dry weight concentrations of uranium in plants range from 5 to 60 parts per billion and ash from burnt wood can have concentrations up to 4 parts per million
