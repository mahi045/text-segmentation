commercialgrade uranium can be produced through the  reduction  of uranium  halides  with  alkali  or  alkaline earth metals
========
it is estimated that 47 million tonnes of uranium ore reserves are economically viable while 35 million tonnes are classed as mineral resources reasonable prospects for eventual economic
extraction
========
exploration for uranium is continuing to increase with us200 million being spent world wide in 2005 a 54 increase on the previous year
========
australia has 40 of the worlds uranium ore reserves and the worlds largest single uranium deposit located at the  olympic dam  mine in  south australia  almost all of the uranium production is exported under strict  international atomic energy agency  safeguards against use in  nuclear weapons
========
the largest single source of uranium ore in the united states was the  colorado plateau  located in colorado utah new mexico and arizona the us federal government paid discovery bonuses and guaranteed purchase prices to anyone who found and delivered uranium ore and was the sole legal purchaser of the uranium the economic incentives resulted in a frenzy of exploration and mining activity throughout the colorado plateau from 1947 through 1959 that left thousands of miles of crudely graded roads spiderwebbing the remote deserts of the colorado plateau and thousands of abandoned uranium mines exploratory shafts and tailings piles the frenzy ended as suddenly as it had begun when the us government stopped purchasing the uranium
========

in 2005 seventeen countries produced concentrated uranium oxides with  canada  279 of world production and  australia  228 being the largest producers and  kazakhstan  105  russia  80  namibia  75  niger  74  uzbekistan  55 the  united states  25  ukraine  19 and  china  17 also producing significant amounts the ultimate supply of uranium is believed to be very large and sufficient for at least the next 85 years although some studies indicate underinvestment in the late twentieth century may produce supply problems in the 21st century it is estimated that for a ten times increase in price the supply of uranium that can be economically mined is increased 300 times

calcined uranium yellowcake as produced in many large mills contains a distribution of uranium oxidation species in various forms ranging from most oxidized to least oxidized particles with short residence times in a calciner will generally be less oxidized than particles that have long retention times or are recovered in the stack scrubber while uranium content is referred to for    content to do so is inaccurate and dates to the days of the  manhattan project  when    was used as an analytical chemistry reporting standard
========
 phase relationships  in the uraniumoxygen system are highly complex the most important oxidation states of uranium are uraniumiv and uraniumvi and their two corresponding  oxides  are respectively  uranium dioxide     and  uranium trioxide     other  uranium oxides  such as uranium monoxide uo diuranium pentoxide    and uranium peroxide    are also known to exist
========
the most common forms of uranium oxide are  triuranium octaoxide     and the aforementioned    both oxide forms are solids that have low solubility in water and are relatively stable over a wide range of environmental conditions triuranium octaoxide is depending on conditions the most stable compound of uranium and is the form most commonly found in nature uranium dioxide is the form in which uranium is most commonly used as a nuclear reactor fuel
========
 ions  that represent the four different  oxidation states  of uranium are  soluble  and therefore can be studied in  aqueous solutions  they are u3 red u4 green    unstable and  chemuo2sup2sup  yellow a few  solid  and semimetallic compounds such as uo and us exist for the formal oxidation state uraniumii but no simple ions are known to exist in solution for that state ions of u3 liberate  hydrogen  from  water  and are therefore considered to be highly unstable the    ion represents the uraniumvi state and is known to form compounds such as the  carbonate   chloride  and  sulfate     also forms  complexes  with various  organic   chelating  agents the most commonlyencountered of which is  uranyl acetate

========
the interactions of carbonate anions with uraniumvi cause the  pourbaix diagram  to change greatly when the medium is changed from water to a carbonate containing solution it is interesting to note that while the vast majority of carbonates are insoluble in water students are often taught that all carbonates other than those of alkali metals are insoluble in water uranium carbonates are often soluble in water this is due to the fact that a uvi cation is able to bind two terminal oxides and three or more carbonates to form anionic complexes
========
the fraction digrams explain this further it can be seen that when the ph of a uraniumvi solution is increased that the uranium is converted to a hydrated uranium oxide hydroxide and then at high phs to an anionic hydroxide complex
========

========
on addition of carbonate to the system the uranium is converted to a series of carbonate complexes when the ph is increased one important overall effect of these reactions is to increase the solubility of the uranium in the range ph 6 to 8 this is important when considering the long term stability of used uranium dioxide nuclear fuels

========
uranium metal heated to 250 to 300  c  482 to 572  f  reacts with  hydrogen  to form  uranium hydride  even higher temperatures will reversibly remove the hydrogen this property makes uranium hydrides convenient starting materials to create reactive uranium powder along with various uranium  carbide   nitride  and  halide  compounds two crystal modifications of uranium hydride exist an α form that is obtained at low temperatures and a β form that is created when the formation temperature is above 250 c
