 star sapphires  and  rubies  get their  asterism  from the  titanium dioxide  impurities present in them

 titanium nitride  tin is often used to coat cutting tools such as  drill bits  it also finds use as a goldcoloured decorative finish and as a  barrier metal  in  semiconductor fabrication
========
 titanium tetrachloride  titaniumiv chloride ticl4 sometimes called tickle is a colourless liquid which is used as an intermediate in the manufacture of titanium dioxide for paint it is widely used in  organic chemistry  as a  lewis acid  for example in the  mukaiyama aldol condensation  titanium also forms a lower chloride  titaniumiii chloride  ticl3 which is used as a  reducing agent
========
 titanocene dichloride  is an important catalyst for carboncarbon bond formation  titanium isopropoxide  is used for  sharpless epoxidation  other compounds include  titanium bromide  used in metallurgy  superalloys  and hightemperature electrical wiring and coatings and  titanium carbide  found in hightemperature cutting tools and coatings
========

naturally occurring titanium is composed of 5 stable  isotopes  46ti 47ti 48ti 49ti and 50ti with 48ti being the most abundant 738  natural abundance  eleven  radioisotopes  have been characterized with the most stable being 44ti with a  halflife  of 63 years 45ti with a halflife of 1848 minutes 51ti with a halflife of 576 minutes and 52ti with a halflife of 17 minutes all of the remaining  radioactive  isotopes have halflives that are less than 33 seconds and the majority of these have halflives that are less than half a second
========
the isotopes of titanium range in  atomic weight  from 3999  u  40ti to 57966 u 58ti the primary  decay mode  before the most abundant stable isotope 48ti is  electron capture  and the primary mode after is  beta emission  the primary  decay products  before 48ti are element 21  scandium  isotopes and the primary products after are element 23  vanadium  isotopes
========

titanium is nontoxic even in large doses and does not play any natural role inside the  human body  an estimated 08 milligrams of titanium is ingested by humans each day but most passes through without being absorbed it does however have a tendency to  bioaccumulate  in tissues that contain  silica  an unknown mechanism in  plants  may use titanium to stimulate the production of  carbohydrates  and encourage growth this may explain why most plants contain about 1  part per million  ppm of titanium food plants have about 2 ppm and  horsetail  and  nettle  contain up to 80 ppm
========
as a powder or in the form of metal shavings titanium metal poses a significant fire hazard and when heated in  air  an explosion hazard water and  carbon dioxide based methods to extinguish fires are ineffective on burning titanium  class d  dry powder fire fighting agents must be used instead
========
even bulk titanium metal is susceptible to fire when it is heated to its melting point a number of titanium fires occur during breaking down devices containing titanium parts with  cutting torches
========
when used in the production or handling of  chlorine  care must be taken to use titanium only in locations where it will not be exposed to dry chlorine gas which can result in a titaniumchlorine fire  care must be taken even when titanium is used in wet chlorine due to possible unexpected drying brought about by extreme weather conditions
========
titanium can catch fire when a fresh nonoxidized surface gets in contact with  liquid oxygen  such surfaces can appear when the oxidized surface is struck with a hard object or when a mechanical strain causes the emergence of a crack this poses the possible limitation for its use in liquid oxygen systems such as those found in the aerospace industry
========
 salts  of titanium are often considered to be relatively harmless but its chlorine compounds such as  ticlsub2sub   ticlsub3sub  and  ticlsub4sub  have presented several unusual hazards the dichloride takes the form of  pyrophoric  black crystals and the tetrachloride is a volatile fuming liquid all of titaniums chlorides are  corrosive
