uranium ore is mined in several ways by  open pit   underground  insitu  leaching  and  borehole mining  see  uranium mining  highgrade ores found in  athabasca basin  deposits in  saskatchewan  canada can contain up to 70 uranium oxides and therefore must be diluted with waste rock prior to milling uranium ore is crushed and rendered into a fine powder and then leached with either an  acid  or  alkali  the leachate is then subjected to one of several sequences of precipitation solvent extraction and ion exchange the resulting mixture called  yellowcake  contains at least 75 uranium oxides yellowcake is then  calcined  to remove impurities from the milling process prior to refining and conversion
