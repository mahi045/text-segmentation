uranium    is a whiteblack  metallic   chemical element  in the  actinide  series of the  periodic table  that has the  symbol  u and  atomic number  92 it has 92  protons  and  electrons  6 of them  valence electrons  it can have between 141 and 146  neutrons  with 143 and 146 in its most common isotopes uranium has the highest atomic weight of the naturally occurring elements uranium is approximately 70 more  dense  than  lead  and is weakly  radioactive  it occurs naturally in low concentrations a few  parts per million  in soil rock and water and is commercially extracted from uraniumbearing  minerals  such as  uraninite  see  uranium mining
========
in nature uranium atoms exist as  uranium238  99284  uranium235  0711 and a very small amount of  uranium234  00058 uranium decays slowly by emitting an  alpha particle  the  halflife  of uranium238 is about 447  billion  years and that of uranium235 is 704  million  years making them useful in dating the  age of the earth  see  uraniumthorium dating   uraniumlead dating  and  uraniumuranium dating  along with  thorium  and  plutonium  uranium is one of the three  fissile  elements meaning it can easily break apart to become lighter elements while uranium238 has a small probability to fission spontaneously or when bombarded with fast neutrons the much higher probability of uranium235 and to a lesser degree  uranium233  to fission when bombarded with slow neutrons generates the heat in  nuclear reactors  used as a source of power and provides the fissile material for  nuclear weapons  both uses rely on the ability of uranium to produce a sustained  nuclear chain reaction   depleted uranium  uranium238 is used in  kinetic energy penetrators  and  armor plating
========
uranium is used as a colorant in  uranium glass  producing orangered to lemon yellow hues it was also used for tinting and shading in early  photography  the 1789  discovery  of uranium in the mineral  pitchblende  is credited to  martin heinrich klaproth  who named the new element after the planet  uranus   eugènemelchior péligot  was the first person to isolate the metal and its radioactive properties were uncovered in 1896 by  antoine becquerel  research by  enrico fermi  and others starting in 1934 led to its use as a fuel in the nuclear power industry and in  little boy  the  first nuclear weapon used in war  an ensuing  arms race  during the  cold war  between the  united states  and the  soviet union  produced tens of thousands of nuclear weapons that used  enriched uranium  and uraniumderived plutonium the security of those weapons and their fissile material following the  breakup of the soviet union  in 1991 along with the legacy of  nuclear testing  and  nuclear accidents  is a concern for public health and safety
========

when  refined  uranium is a silvery white weakly radioactive  metal  which is slightly softer than  steel  strongly  electropositive  and a poor  electrical conductor
========
uranium metal reacts with nearly all nonmetallic elements and their  compounds  with reactivity increasing with temperature  hydrochloric  and  nitric acids  dissolve uranium but nonoxidizing acids attack the element very slowly
========
uranium was the first element that was found to be  fissile  upon bombardment with slow  neutrons  its  uranium235   isotope  becomes a very shortlived uranium236 isotope which immediately divides into two smaller  nuclei  releasing nuclear  binding energy  and more neutrons if these neutrons are absorbed by other uranium235 nuclei a  nuclear chain reaction  occurs and if there is nothing to absorb some neutrons and slow the reaction the reaction is explosive as little as 15nbsplb 7nbspkg of uranium235 can be used to make an atomic bomb the first atomic bomb worked by this principle nuclear fission
========

the major application of uranium in the military sector is in highdensity penetrators this ammunition consists of  depleted uranium  du alloyed with 12 other elements at high impact speed the density hardness and flammability of the projectile enable destruction of heavily armored targets tank armor and the removable armor on combat vehicles are also hardened with depleted uranium du plates the use of du became a contentious politicalenvironmental issue after the use of du munitions by the us uk and other countries during wars in the persian gulf and the balkans raised questions of uranium compounds left in the soil see  gulf war syndrome
========
depleted uranium is also used as a shielding material in some containers used to store and transport radioactive materials counter to popular belief the main risk of exposure to du is chemical poisoning by uranium oxide rather than radioactivity uranium being only a weak  alpha emitter
========
during the later stages of  world war ii  the entire  cold war  and to a much lesser extent afterwards uranium was used as the fissile explosive material to produce  nuclear weapons  two major types of fission bombs were built a relatively simple device that uses  uranium235  and a more complicated mechanism that uses  uranium238 derived  plutonium239  later a much more complicated and far more powerful fusion bomb that uses a plutoniumbased device in a uranium casing to cause a mixture of  tritium  and  deuterium  to undergo  nuclear fusion  was built
========

the main use of uranium in the civilian sector is to fuel commercial  nuclear power plants  by the time it is completely fissioned one kilogram of uranium can theoretically produce about 20nbsp trillion   joules  of energy 20  nbspjoules as much  electricity  as 1500  tonnes  of  coal
========
commercial  nuclear power  plants use fuel that is typically enriched to around 3 uranium235

prior to the discovery of  radiation  uranium was primarily used in small amounts for yellow glass and pottery dyes such as  uranium glass  and in  fiestaware  uranium was also used in  photographic  chemicals esp  uranium nitrate  as a  toner
========
the discovery of the radioactivity of uranium ushered in additional scientific and practical uses of the element the long  halflife  of the isotope uranium238 451   years makes it wellsuited for use in estimating the age of the earliest  igneous rocks  and for other types of  radiometric dating  including  uraniumthorium dating  and  uraniumlead dating  uranium metal is used for  xray  targets in the making of highenergy xrays
========
the use of uranium in its natural  oxide  form dates back to at least the year 79 when it was used to add a yellow color to  ceramic  glazes yellow glass with 1 uranium oxide was found in a  roman  villa on cape  posillipo  in the  bay of naples   italy  by r t gunther of the  university of oxford  in 1912 starting in the late  middle ages   pitchblende  was extracted from the  habsburg  silver mines in  joachimsthal   bohemia  now jáchymov in the  czech republic  and was used as a coloring agent in the local  glassmaking  industry
