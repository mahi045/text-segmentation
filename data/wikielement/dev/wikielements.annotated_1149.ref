the word tin has cognates in many germanic and celtic languages the american heritage dictionary speculates that the word was borrowed from a preindoeuropean language the later name stannum and its  romance  derivatures come from the leadsilver alloy of the same name for the finding of the latter in ores the former stagnum was the word for a stale pool or puddle
========
in modern times the word tin is often improperly used as a generic phrase for any silvery metal that comes in sheets most everyday materials that are commonly called tin such as  aluminum foil   beverage cans  corrugated building sheathing and  tin cans  are actually made of  steel  or  aluminum  although tin cans tinned cans do contain a thin coating of tin to inhibit rust likewise socalled tin  toys  are usually made of steel and may or may not have a coating of tin to inhibit rust

in 2005 china was the largest producer of tin with at least onethird of the worlds share closely followed by  indonesia  and south america reports the  british geological survey
========
tin is produced by reducing the  ore  with  coal  in a  reverberatory furnace  this metal is a relatively scarce element with an abundance in the  earth s  crust  of about 2  ppm  compared with 94 ppm for zinc 63 ppm for copper and 12 ppm for lead most of the worlds tin is produced from  placer  deposits the only  mineral  of commercial importance as a source of tin is  cassiterite  sn o 2 although small quantities of tin are recovered from complex  sulfides  such as  stannite   cylindrite   franckeite   canfieldite  and  teallite  secondary or scrap tin is also an important source of the metal

 tasmania  hosts some deposits of historical importance most notably  mount bischoff  and  renison bell
========
it is esimtated that at current consumption rates the earth will run out of tin in 40 years however lester brown has suggested tin could run out within 20 years based on an extremely conservative extrapolation of 2 growth per year

tin is the element with the greatest number of stable isotopes ten which is probably related to the fact that 50 is a  magic number  of protons  28 additional unstable isotopes are known including the  doubly magic  tin100 100sn discovered in 1994

tellurium    is a  chemical element  that has the symbol te and  atomic number  52 a brittle silverwhite  metalloid  which looks like  tin  tellurium is chemically related to  selenium  and  sulfur  tellurium is primarily used in  alloys  and as a  semiconductor
========
tellurium is extremely rare one of the  nine rarest elements  on earth it is in the same chemical family as  oxygen   sulfur   selenium  and  polonium  the  chalcogens
========
when  crystalline  tellurium is silverywhite and when it is in its pure state it has a metallic luster this is a brittle and easily pulverized metalloid amorphous tellurium is found by precipitating it from a solution of tellurous or telluric  acid  teoh6 however there is some debate whether this form is really amorphous or made of minute crystals
========
tellurium is a ptype  semiconductor  that shows a greater conductivity in certain directions which depends on  atomic  alignment chemically related to  selenium  and  sulfur  the conductivity of this element increases slightly when exposed to light
