samarium    is a  chemical element  with the symbol sm and  atomic number  62
========

========
samarium is a rare earth metal with a bright silver luster that is reasonably stable in air it ignites in air at 150  c  even with longterm storage under mineral oil samarium is gradually oxidized with a grayishyellow powder of the oxidehydroxide being formed three crystal modifications of the metal also exist with transformations at 734 and 922 c
========
uses of samarium include
========
 carbonarc lighting for the  motion picture industry  together with other rare earth metals
 caf2 crystals for use in optical  masers  or  lasers
 as a  neutron absorber  in  nuclear reactors
 for alloys and headphones
  samariumcobalt magnets  smco5 and sm2co17 are used in making permanent magnet materials that have high resistance to demagnetization when compared to other permanent magnet materials these materials have high coercivities and intrinsic coercivities  samariumcobalt combinations have recently found use in highend magnetic  pickups  for guitars and related musical instruments
  samariumii iodide  is used as a  chemical reagent  in  organic synthesis  for example in the  barbier reaction
 samarium oxide is used in optical glass to absorb infrared light
 samarium compounds act as sensitizers for phosphors excited in the infrared
 samarium oxide is a  catalyst  for the dehydration and  dehydrogenation  of ethanol
 radioactive samarium153 is used in medicine to treat the severe pain associated with cancers that have spread to bone the drug is called  quadramet

samarium was first discovered spectroscopically in  1853  by  swiss   chemist   jean charles galissard de marignac  by its sharp  absorption lines  in  didymium  and isolated in  paris  in  1879  by  french  chemist  paul émile lecoq de boisbaudran  from the mineral  samarskite  yceufe3nbtati5o16 although samarskite was first found in the urals by the late 1870s a new deposit had been located in north carolina and it was from that source that the samariumbearing didymium had originated
========
the samarskite mineral was named after  vasili samarskybykhovets  the chief of staff colonel of the  russian  corps of mining engineers
in 1845ndash1861 the name of the element is derived from the name of the mineral and thus traces back to the name samarskybykhovets in this sense samarium was the first chemical element to be named after a living person
========
prior to the advent of ionexchange separation technology in the 1950s samarium had no commercial uses in pure form  however a byproduct of the fractional crystallization purification of neodymium was a mixture of samarium and gadolinium that acquired the name of lindsay mix after the company that made it  this material is thought to have been used for nuclear control rods in some of the early nuclear reactors  nowadays a similar commodity product goes under the name of samarium europium  gadolinium  concentrate or seg concentrate  this is prepared by solvent extraction from the mixed lanthanides extracted from bastnäsite or monazite  since the heavier lanthanides have the greater affinity for the solvent used they are easily extracted from the bulk using relatively small proportions of solvent   not all rare earth producers who process bastnäsite do so on large enough scale to continue onward with the separation of the components of seg which typically makes up only one or two percent of the original ore  such producers will therefore be making seg with a view to marketing it to the specialized processors  in this manner the valuable europium content of the ore is rescued for use in phosphor manufacture samarium purification follows the removal of the europium  currently being in oversupply samarium oxide is less expensive on a commercial scale than its relative abundance in the ore might suggest
========
samarium has no known biological role but is said to stimulate the  metabolism
========
samarium is never found free in nature but like other rare earth elements is contained in many minerals including  monazite   bastnasite  and  samarskite  monazite in which it occurs up to an extent of 28 and bastnäsite are also used as commercial sources  misch metal  containing about 1 of samarium has long been used but it was not until recent years that relatively pure samarium has been isolated through  ion exchange  processes  solvent extraction  techniques and  electrochemical deposition  the metal is often prepared by electrolysis of a molten mixture of  samariumiii chloride  with  sodium chloride  or  calcium chloride  1  samarium can also be obtained by reducing its oxide with  lanthanum

naturally occurring samarium is composed of 4 stable  isotopes  144sm 150sm 152sm and 154sm and 3 extremely longlived  radioisotopes  147sm 106  y 148sm 7  y and 149sm 2  y with 152sm being the most abundant 2675  natural abundance
========
 sup151supsm  has a  halflife  of 90 years and 145sm has a halflife of 340 days all of the remaining  radioisotopes  have halflives that are less than 2 days and the majority of these have halflives that are less than 48 seconds this element also has 5  meta states  with the most stable being 141msm t 226 minutes 143m1sm t 66 seconds and 139msm t 107 seconds
========
the primary  decay mode  before the most abundant stable isotope 152sm is  electron capture  and the primary mode after is  beta minus decay  the primary  decay products  before 152sm are element pm  promethium  isotopes and the primary products after are element eu  europium  isotopes
========
natural samarium has an activity of 128  bq g
========
as with the other lanthanides samarium compounds are of low to moderate  toxicity  although their toxicity has not been investigated in detail
