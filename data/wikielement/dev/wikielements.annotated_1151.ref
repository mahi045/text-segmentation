tellurium gives a greenishblue flame when burned in normal air and forms  tellurium dioxide  as a result
========
metal alloys
it is mostly used in  alloys  with other metals it is added to  lead  to improve its strength and durability and to decrease the corrosive action of  sulfuric acid
when added to  stainless steel  and  copper  it makes these metals more workable it is alloyed into  cast iron  for chill control
========
other uses
 used in  ceramics
 it is used in  chalcogenide glasses
 tellurium is also used in  blasting caps
 organic tellurides have also been employed as initiators for living radical polymerisation and electronrich mono and ditellurides possess  antioxidant  activity
========
high purity  metalorganics  of both  selenium  and tellurium are used in the semiconductor industry and are prepared by  adduct purification

 bismuth telluride  bi2te3 has found use in  thermoelectric  devices

tellurium has potential applications in  cadmium telluride  cdte  solar panels  some of the highest efficiencies for solar cell electric power generation have been obtained by using this material  first solar inc  started massive commercial production of cdte solar panels in recent years significantly increased tellurium demand if some of the cadmium in cdte is replaced by  zinc  then  cdznte  is formed which is used in solidstate  xray  detectors
========
alloyed with both cadmium and  mercury  to form  mercury cadmium telluride  an  infrared  sensitive  semiconductor  material is formed organotellurium compounds such as  dimethyl telluride   diethyl telluride   diisopropyl telluride   diallyl telluride  and  methyl allyl telluride  are used as precursors for  movpe  growth of iivi  compound semiconductors  diisopropyl telluride dipte is employed as the preferred precursor for achieving the low temperature growth of cdhgte by  movpe

tellurium  latin  tellus meaning earth was discovered in 1782 by the hungarian  franzjoseph müller von reichenstein  müller ferenc in  nagyszeben  now sibiu  transylvania
in 1789 another hungarian scientist pál kitaibel also discovered the element independently but later he gave the credit to müller in 1798 it was named by  martin heinrich klaproth  who earlier isolated it
========
tellurium was used as a chemical bonder in the making of the outer shell of the first atom bomb the 1960s brought growth in thermoelectric applications for tellurium as well as its use in freemachining  steel  which became the dominant use
========
with an abundance in the earths  crust  even lower than  platinum  tellurium is apart from the  precious metals  the rarest stable solid element in the earths crust its abundance by mass is less than 0001  ppm  compare with 0037  ppm  for  platinum  by comparison even the rarest of the  lanthanides  have crustal abundances of 05 ppm
========
the extreme rarity of tellurium in the earths crust is not a reflection of its cosmic abundance which is in fact greater than that of  rubidium    even though rubidium is ten thousand times more abundant in the earths crust rather the extraordinarily low abundance of tellurium on earth results from the fact that during the formation of the earth the stable form of elements in the absence of  oxygen  and  water  was controlled by the oxidation and reduction of  hydrogen  under this scenario elements such as tellurium which form volatile hydrides were severely depleted during the formation of the earths crust through evaporation tellurium and selenium are the heavy elements most depleted in the earths crust by this process
========
tellurium is sometimes found in its native elemental form but is more often found as the tellurides of  gold   calaverite   krennerite   petzite   sylvanite  and others tellurium compounds are the only chemical compounds of gold found in nature but tellurium itself unlike gold is also found combined with other elements in metallic salts the principal source of tellurium is from  anode  sludges produced during the electrolytic refining of blister  copper  it is a component of dusts from  blast furnace  refining of  lead  treatment of 500 tons of copper ore  typically yields  one pound of tellurium tellurium is produced mainly in the  us   canada   peru  and  japan   see here
========
commercialgrade tellurium is usually marketed as minus 200 mesh  powder but is also available as slabs ingots sticks or lumps  the yearend price for tellurium in 2000 was  us 14 per pound in recent years tellurium price was  driven up  by increased demand and limited supply reaching as high as  us 100 per pound in 2006  see also here
