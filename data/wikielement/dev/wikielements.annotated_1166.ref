naturally occurring terbium is composed of 1 stable  isotope  159tb 33  radioisotopes  have been characterized with the most stable being 158tb with a  halflife  of 180 years 157tb with a halflife of 71 years and 160tb with a halflife of 723 days all of the remaining  radioactive  isotopes have halflifes that are less than 6907 days and the majority of these have half lifes that are less than 24 seconds this element also has 18  meta states  with the most stable being 156m1tb t 244 hours 154m2tb t 227 hours and 154m1tb t 94 hours
========
the primary  decay mode  before the most abundant stable isotope 159tb is  electron capture  and the primary mode behind is  beta minus decay  the primary  decay products  before 159tb are element gd  gadolinium  isotopes and the primary products behind are element dy  dysprosium  isotopes
========
as with the other  lanthanides  terbium compounds are of low to moderate toxicity although their toxicity has not been investigated in detail terbium has no known biological role

tungsten    also called wolfram    is a  chemical element  that has the symbol w  german  wolfram and  atomic number  74 a very hard heavy steelgray to white  transition metal  tungsten is found in several  ores  including  wolframite  and  scheelite  and is remarkable for its robust physical properties especially the fact that it has the highest  melting point  of all the non alloyed  metals and the second highest of all the elements after  carbon  the pure form is used mainly in electrical applications but its many compounds and alloys are widely used in many applications most notably in  light bulb  filaments in  xray tubes  as both the filament and target and in  superalloys  tungsten is the only metal from the third transition series that is known to occur in  biomolecules
========

naturally occurring tungsten consists of five  isotopes  whose  halflives  are so long that they can be considered  stable  all can decay into isotopes of element 72  hafnium  by  alpha emission  180w has been observed to have a half life of 18  02  ea   the other naturally occurring isotopes have not been observed to decay constraining their halflives to be 182w t12  83 ea 184w t12  29 ea 185w t12  13 ea 186w t12  27 ea    on average two alpha decays of 180w occur in one gram of natural tungsten per year
========
27 artificial  radioisotopes  of tungsten have been characterized the most stable of which are 181w with a  halflife  of 1212nbspdays 185w with a halflife of 751nbspdays 188w with a halflife of 694nbspdays and 178w with a halflife of 216nbspdays  all of the remaining  radioactive  isotopes have halflives of less than 24nbsphours and most of these have halflives that are less than 8nbspminutes tungsten also has 4nbsp meta states  the most stable being 179mw t 64 minutes

pure tungsten is steelgray to tinwhite and is a hard metal tungsten can be cut with a  hacksaw  when it is very pure it is brittle and hard to work when impure and is otherwise worked by  forging   drawing   extruding  or  sintering  of all metals at temperatures above 1650nbspc 3000nbspf this element has the highest  melting point  3422nbsp c  6192nbsp f  lowest  vapor pressure  and the highest  tensile strength  tungsten has the lowest  coefficient of thermal expansion  of any pure metal its corrosion resistance is excellent and it can be attacked only slightly by most  mineral acids  tungsten metal forms a protective  oxide  when exposed to air but can be oxidized at high temperature  steel  alloyed with small quantities of tungsten greatly increases its toughness
========
the most common formal  oxidation state  of tungsten is 6  but it exhibits all oxidation states from 1 to 6 tungsten typically combines with oxygen to form the yellow  tungstic oxide  wo3 which dissolves in aqueous alkaline solutions to form tungstate ions wo42minus
========
aqueous tungstate solutions are noted for the formation of  polyoxoanions  under neutral and acidic conditions as tungstate is progressively treated with acid it first yields the soluble metastable paratungstate a  anion  w7o246minus which over hours or days converts to the less soluble paratungstate b anion h2w12o4210minus further acidification produces the very soluble metatungstate anion h2w12o406minus after equilibrium is reached the metatungstate ion exists as a symmetric cluster of twelve tungsten oxygen   octahedra  known as the  keggin  anion many other polyoxoanions exist as  metastable  species  the inclusion of a different atom such as phosphorus in place of the two central hydrogens in metatungstate produces a wide variety of  heteropoly acids  such as  phosphotungstic acid  h3p w12o40 in this example
