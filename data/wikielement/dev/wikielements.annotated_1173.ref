several complicated steps are involved in the separation of tantalum from  niobium  commercially viable production of this element can follow one of several different methods which includes  electrolysis  of molten  potassium  fluorotantalate  reduction  of potassium fluorotantalate with  sodium  or by reacting tantalum carbide with tantalum oxide tantalum is also a byproduct from  tin  smelting
========
 los alamos national laboratory  scientists have developed a  tantalum carbide  graphite   composite  material that is one of the hardest materials ever synthesized  korean researchers have developed an amorphous tantalumtungstencopper alloy which is more flexible and two to three times stronger than traditional steel alloys

natural tantalum consists of two  isotopes  ta181 is a stable isotope and ta180m has a  half life  of over  10sup15sup  years see  scientific notation  and is a  nuclear isomer  of ta180  ta180 has a  ground state    half life  of only 8 hours
========
tantalum has been proposed as a  salting  material for  nuclear weapons   cobalt  is another betterknown salting material a jacket of 181ta irradiated by the intense highenergy neutron flux from an exploding thermonuclear weapon would transmute into the radioactive isotope 182ta with a  halflife  of 11443 days and produce approximately 112  mev  of  gamma radiation  significantly increasing the radioactivity of the weapons  fallout  for several months such a weapon is not known to have ever been built tested or used
========
compounds containing tantalum are rarely encountered and the metal does not normally cause problems in the laboratory but it should still be handled with care taking the usual laboratory precautions there is some evidence that tantalum compounds can cause  tumors  and its metal dust is a  fire  and  explosion  hazard

thallium    is a  chemical element  with the symbol tl and  atomic number  81  this soft gray malleable  poor metal  resembles  tin  but discolors when exposed to air thallium is highly  toxic  and is used in  rat poisons  and  insecticides  but since it might also cause  cancer  although the  united states epa  does not class it as carcinogen this use has been cut back or eliminated in many countries it is also used in  infrared detectors
it has even been used in some  murders  earning the nicknames the poisoners poison and inheritance powder alongside  arsenic
========

========
this metal is very soft and malleable and can be cut with a knife when it is first exposed to air thallium has a metallic  luster  but quickly tarnishes with a bluishgray tinge that resembles  lead  it is preserved by keeping it under oil a heavy layer of  oxide  builds up on thallium if left in air  in the presence of water thallium  hydroxide  is formed
========
the  odorless  and  tasteless   thallium sulfate  was widely used in the past as a  rat poison  and  ant  killer in the  united states  and many other countries this use is no longer allowed due to safety concerns other uses
 thallium sulfide s  electrical conductivity  changes with exposure to  infrared light  therefore making this compound useful in  photocells
thallium  bromide  iodide   crystals  have been used as infrared optical materials because they are harder than other common infrared optics and because they have transmission at significantly longer wavelengths  the trade name krs5 referes to this material
 thallium oxide  has been used to manufacture  glasses  that have a high  index of refraction
used in  semiconductor  materials for selenium rectifiers
in  gamma radiation  detection equipment
highdensity liquid used for sinkfloat separation of  minerals
used in the treatment of  ringworm  and other  skin infections  however this use has been limited due to the narrow margin that exists between toxicity and therapeutic benefit
 radioactive  thallium201 halflife of 73 hours is used for diagnostic purposes in  nuclear medicine  particularly in stress tests used for risk stratification in patients with  coronary artery disease    acad this isotope of thallium can be generated using a transportable generator which is similar to the  technetium cow  the generator contains  lead 201 half life 933 hours which decays by  electron capture  to the thallium201 the lead201 can be produced in a  cyclotron  by the bombardment of thallium with  protons  or  deuterons  by the p3n and d4n reactions
========
combined with  sulfur  or  selenium  and  arsenic  thallium has been used in the production of high density  glasses that have low  melting points  in the range of 125 and 150  c  these glasses have room temperature properties that are similar to ordinary glasses and are durable insoluble in water and have unique  refractive indices
thallium amalgam is used in thermometers for low temperature because it freezes at 58 c pure mercury freezes at 38 c
========
in addition research activity with thallium is ongoing to develop hightemperature  superconducting  materials for such applications as  magnetic resonance imaging  storage of magnetic energy  magnetic propulsion  and  electric power generation  and transmission
========
thallium  greek  θαλλός thallos meaning a green shoot or twig was discovered by  sir william crookes  in  1861  in  england  while he was making spectroscopic determinations for  tellurium  on residues from a  sulfuric acid  plant the name comes from thalliums bright  green  spectral  emission lines  in 1862 crookes and  claudeauguste lamy  isolated the metal independently of each other
