in terms of fabrication all  welding  of titanium must be done in an inert atmosphere of  argon  or  helium  in order to shield it from contamination with atmospheric gases such as oxygen  nitrogen  or  hydrogen  the metal can be machined using the same equipment and via the same processes as  stainless steel
========

titanium is used in  steel  as an alloying element  ferrotitanium  to reduce  grain size  and as a deoxidizer and in  stainless steel  to reduce  carbon  content applications for titanium mill products sheet plate bar wire forgings castings can be found in industrial aerospace recreational and emerging markets powdered titanium is used in  pyrotechnics  as a source of brightburning particles
========

about 95 of titanium ore extracted from the earth is destined for refinement into  titanium dioxide     an intensely white permanent  pigment  used in  paints   paper   toothpaste  and  plastics  it is also used in  cement  in  gemstones  as an optical opacifier in  paper  and a strengthening agent in graphite composite fishing rods and golf clubs
========
   powder is chemically inert resists fading in sunlight and is very opaque this allows it to impart a pure and brilliant white color to the brown or gray chemicals that form the majority of household plastics
========
recently it has been put to use in air purifiers as a filter coating or in film used to coat windows on buildings which when exposed to  uv light  either solar or manmade and moisture in the air produces reactive redox species like hydroxyl radicals that can purify the air or keep window surfaces clean
========

due to their high  tensile strength  to density ratio in engine applications titanium is used for rotors compressor blades hydraulic system components and  nacelles  the  titanium 6al4v  alloy accounts for almost 50 of all alloys used in aircraft applications
========
due to its high corrosion resistance to  sea water  titanium is used to make propeller shafts and rigging and in the  heat exchangers  of  desalination plants
========
welded titanium pipe and process equipment heat exchangers tanks process vessels valves are used in the chemical and petrochemical industries primarily for corrosion resistance specific alloys are used in downhole and  nickel   hydrometallurgy  applications due to their high strength  titanium beta c  or corrosion resistance or combination of both the  pulp and paper  industry uses titanium in process equipment exposed to corrosive media such as sodium hypochlorite or wet chlorine gas in the bleachery other applications include  ultrasonic welding   wave soldering  and  sputtering targets

========
titanium metal is used in automotive applications particularly in automobile or motorcycle racing where weight reduction is critical while maintaining high strength and rigidity the metal is generally too expensive to make it marketable to the general consumer market other than high end products late model  corvettes  have been available with titanium exhausts and racing bikes are frequently outfitted with titanium mufflers titanium alloy is used for the connecting rods in the engine of the 2006 and later corvette z06 other automotive uses include piston rods and hardware bolts nuts etc
========
the  parker pen company  used titanium to form the t1 fountain pen later expanded to t1 ball pens and rollerballs  the t1 fountain pen was introduced in 1970 and the t1 rollerball and ball pen in 1971  production was stopped in 1972 due to the high cost of manufacturing titanium  parker t1s are prized for their collectibility by collectors
========
 hammer  heads made of titanium were introduced in 1999 their light weight allows for a longer handle which increases the velocity of the head and results in more energy being delivered to the nail all while decreasing arm fatigue titanium also decreases the shock transferred to the user because a titanium head generates about 3 recoil compared to a steel head that generates about 27
========
titanium is used in many sporting goods  tennis rackets   golf clubs   lacrosse  stick shafts  cricket  hockey lacrosse and football helmet grills and  bicycle  frames and components titanium alloys are also used in  spectacle  frames this results in a rather expensive but highly durable and long lasting frame which is light in weight and causes no skin allergies many  backpackers  use titanium equipment including cookware eating utensils lanterns and tent stakes though slightly more expensive than traditional steel or aluminium alternatives these titanium products can be significantly lighter without compromising strength titanium is also favored for use by  farriers  since it is lighter and more durable than  steel  when formed into  horseshoes   titanium horseshoes can be found in  horse racing  and are used by many  amish  horse owners who rely entirely on horsedrawn carriages for transportation  titanium has even become somewhat popular for use in jewelry such as rings and body piercings
========
because of its durability titanium has become more popular for designer jewelry in recent years whereas until recently the metal was too difficult to work into the intricate shapes with the precision necessary for fine  jewelry  today titanium rings  including  engagement rings  and  wedding bands   are one of the fastest growing segments of the titanium jewelry market in part due to the ability of the metal to be grooved inlaid and carved without losing strength some titanium jewelry also incorporates  diamonds  or other gemstones typically in close settings such as bezels flush or tension designs  its inertness again makes it a good choice for those with allergies or those who will be wearing the jewelry in environments such as swimming pools
========
titanium has occasionally been used in architectural applications the 120nbspfoot 40nbspm memorial to  yuri gagarin  the first man to travel in space in  moscow  is made of titanium for the metals attractive color and association with rocketry the  guggenheim museum bilbao  and the  cerritos millennium library  were the first buildings in europe and north america respectively to be sheathed in titanium panels other construction uses of titanium sheathing include the  frederic c hamilton building  in  denver   colorado
========
due to its superior strength and light weight when compared to other metals traditionally used in firearms  steel   stainless steel  and  aluminum  and advances in metalworking techniques the use of titanium has become more widespread in the manufacture of firearms  primary uses include  pistol  frames and  revolver  cylinders
========


because it is biocompatible nontoxic and is not rejected by the body titanium is used in a gamut of medical applications including surgical implements and implants such as hip balls and sockets  joint replacement  that can stay in place for up to 20 years titanium has the inherent property to  osseointegrate  enabling use in  dental implants  that can remain in place for over 30 years this property is also useful for orthopedic implant applications
========
since titanium is non ferromagnetic  patients with titanium implants can be safely examined with  magnetic resonance imaging  convenient for longterm implants preparing titanium for implantation in the body involves subjecting it to a hightemperature  plasma  arc which removes the surface atoms exposing fresh titanium that is instantly oxidized
========
its inertness and ability to be attractively colored makes it a popular metal for use in  body piercing  titanium may be  anodized  to produce various colors a number of artists work with titanium to produce artworks such as sculptures decorative objects and furniture
