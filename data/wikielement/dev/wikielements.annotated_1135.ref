seaborgium    also called  eka  tungsten  is a  chemical element  in the  periodic table  that has the symbol sg and  atomic number  106 seaborgium is a  synthetic element  whose most stable  isotope  271sg has a  halflife  of 24  minutes   its chemistry probably resembles that of tungsten
========
element 106 was discovered almost simultaneously by two different laboratories in june  1974  an  american  research team led by  albert ghiorso  at the  lawrence radiation laboratory  at the  university of california berkeley  reported creating an isotope with mass number 263 and a halflife of 10 s and in september  1974  a  soviet  team led by  g n flerov  at the  joint institute for nuclear research  at  dubna  reported producing an isotope with mass number 259 and a halflife of 048  s
========
because their work was independently confirmed first the americans suggested the name seaborgium to honor the american chemist  glenn t seaborg  credited as a member of the american team along with ghiorso  j m nitschke   j r alonso   c t alonso   m nurmia   e kenneth hulet  and  r w lougheed  in recognition of his participation in the discovery of several other actinides  the name selected by the team became controversial an international committee decided in  1992  that the berkeley and dubna laboratories should share credit for the discovery
========
an  element naming controversy  erupted and as a result  iupac  adopted unnilhexium    symbol unh as a temporary  systematic element name  in  1994  a committee of iupac recommended that element 106 be named rutherfordium and adopted a rule that no element can be named after a living person this ruling was fiercely objected to by the  american chemical society  critics pointed out that a precedent had been set in the naming of  einsteinium  during  albert einstein s life in  1997  as part of a compromise involving elements 104 to 108 the name seaborgium for element 106 was recognized internationally
========

there are 12 known isotopes of seaborgium the longestlived of which is 271sg which decays through  alpha decay  and  spontaneous fission  it has a halflife of 24 minutes the shortestlived isotope is 258sg which also decays through alpha decay and spontaneous fission it has a halflife of 29  ms

titanium    is a  chemical element  with the symbol ti and  atomic number  22 it is a light strong lustrous  corrosion resistant including resistance to  sea water  and  chlorine   transition metal  with a grayish  color  titanium can be  alloyed  with other elements such as  iron   aluminium   vanadium   molybdenum  and others to produce strong lightweight alloys for aerospace  jet engines   missiles  and  spacecraft  military industrial process chemicals and petrochemicals  desalination plants  pulp and paper automotive agrifood medical  prostheses  orthopaedic implants dental implants sporting goods jewelry and other applications titanium was discovered in  england  by  william gregor  in 1791 and named by  martin heinrich klaproth  for the  titans  of  greek mythology
========
the element occurs within a number of mineral deposits principally  rutile  and  ilmenite  which are widely distributed in the  earth s crust and lithosphere and it is found in almost all living things rocks water bodies and soils other compounds include  titanium tetrachloride  ticl4 used in  smoke screens  skywriting  and as a  catalyst  and  titanium trichloride  used as a catalyst in the production of  polypropylene
========
the two most useful properties of the metal form are corrosion resistance and the highest strengthtoweight ratio of any metal in its unalloyed condition titanium is as strong as some  steels  but 45 lighter and five naturally occurring  isotopes  of this element 46ti through 50ti with 48ti being the most  abundant  738 titaniums properties are chemically and physically similar to  zirconium
========
titanium was  discovered  combined in a  mineral  in  cornwall   england  in 1791 by amateur geologist and pastor  william gregor  the then vicar of  creed  parish he recognized the presence of a new element in  ilmenite  gregor realizing that the unidentified oxide contained a metal that did not match the properties of any known element reported his findings to the  royal geological society of cornwall  and in the german science journal  crells annalen
========

around the same time  franz joseph muller  also produced a similar substance but could not identify it klaproth found that it contained a new element and named it for the  titans  of  greek mythology
========
the processes required to extract titanium from its various ores are laborious and costly it is not possible to reduce in the normal manner by heating in the presence of  carbon  because that produces  titanium carbide
========

========
titanium of very high purity was made in small quantities when  anton eduard van arkel  and  jan hendrik de boer  discovered the iodide or  crystal bar  process in 1925 by reacting with iodine and decomposing the formed vapors over a hot filament to pure metal
========
in the 1950s and 1960s the  soviet union  pioneered the use of titanium in military and submarine applications  alfa class  and  mike class  as part of programs related to the cold war
starting in the early 1950s titanium began to be used extensively for military aviation purposes particularly in highperformance jets starting with aircraft such as the  f100 super sabre  and  lockheed a12
========
in the usa the  department of defense  realized the strategic importance of the metal and supported early efforts of commercialization

throughout the period of the  cold war  titanium was considered a strategic material by the us government and a large stockpile of titanium sponge was maintained by the defense national stockpile center which was finally depleted in 2005 today the worlds largest producer russianbased  vsmpoavisma  is estimated to account for about 29 of the world market share
========
in 2006 the us defense agency awarded 57nbspmillion to a twocompany consortium to develop a new process for making titanium metal  powder  under heat and pressure the powder can be used to create strong lightweight items ranging from armor plating to components for the aerospace transportation and chemical processing industries
