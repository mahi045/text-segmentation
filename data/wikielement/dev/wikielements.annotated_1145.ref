in 1998   john t armstrong  of the  national institute of standards and technology  ran computer simulations of the 1925 experiments and obtained results quite close to those reported by the noddack team he claimed that this was further supported by work published by  david curtis  of the  los alamos national laboratory  measuring the tiny natural occurrence of technetium however the noddacks experimental results have never been reproduced and they were unable to isolate any element 43 debate still exists as to whether the 1925 team actually did discover element 43
========
 discovery  of element 43 was finally confirmed in a 1937 experiment at the  university of palermo  in sicily conducted by  carlo perrier  and  emilio segrè  in the summer of 1936  segrè and his wife visited the united states first new york at  columbia university  where he had spent time the previous summer and then  berkeley  at  ernest o lawrence s  radiation laboratory  he persuaded  cyclotron  inventor lawrence to let him take back some discarded cyclotron parts that had become radioactive in early 1937 lawrence mailed him a molybdenum foil that had been part of the deflector in the cyclotron segrè enlisted his experienced chemist colleague perrier to attempt to prove through comparative chemistry that the molybdenum activity was indeed z  43 an element not existent in nature because of its instability against nuclear decay with considerable difficulty they finally succeeded in isolating three distinct decay periods 90 80 and 50 days that eventually turned out to be two isotopes 95tc and 97tc of technetium the name given later by perrier and segrè to the first manmade element university of palermo officials wanted them to name their discovery panormium after the  latin  name for  palermo  panormus the researchers instead named element 43 after the  greek  word τεχνητός meaning artificial since it was the first element to be artificially produced
========
in 1952 astronomer  paul w merrill  in  california  detected the  spectral signature  of technetium in particular light at 4031 nm 4238 nm 4268 nm and 4297 nm in light from  stype   red giants  more recently such observations provided evidence that elements were being formed by  neutron capture  in the  sprocess
========
since its discovery there have been many searches in terrestrial materials for natural sources in 1962 technetium99 was isolated and identified in  pitchblende  from the  belgian congo  in extremely small quantities about 02 ngkg there is also evidence that the  oklo   natural nuclear fission reactor  produced significant amounts of technetium99 which has since decayed to ruthenium99
========
since technetium is unstable only minute traces occur naturally in the  earth s crust as a spontaneous  fission product  of  uranium   in 1999 david curtis see above estimated that a kilogram of uranium contains 1 nanogram 1109 g of technetium  extraterrestrial technetium was found in some  red giant  stars s m and ntypes that contain an absorption line in their spectrum indicating the presence of this element

========
in contrast with the rare natural occurrence bulk quantities of technetium99 are produced each year from  spent   nuclear fuel  rods which contain various  fission products   the fission of a gram of  uranium235  in  nuclear reactors  yields 27 mg of 99tc giving technetium a  fission product yield  of 61 other  fissile  isotopes also produce similar yields of technetium
========
it is estimated that up to 1994 about 49000 t bq  78  metric tons  of technetium was produced in nuclear reactors which is by far the dominant source of terrestrial technetium however only a fraction of the production is used commercially   as of 2005  technetium99 is available to holders of an  ornl  permit for  us 83g plus packing charges
========
since the yield of technetium99 as a  product  of the  nuclear fission  of both  uranium 235 and  plutonium 239 is moderate it is present in  radioactive waste  of fission reactors and is produced when a  fission bomb  is detonated  the amount of  artificially produced technetium in the environment exceeds its natural occurrence to a large extent this is due to release by atmospheric  nuclear testing  along with the disposal and processing of highlevel  radioactive waste   due to its high fission yield and relatively high halflife technetium99 is one of the main components of nuclear waste its decay measured in becquerels per amount of spent fuel is dominant at about 104 to 106 years after the creation of the nuclear waste
========
an estimated 160 t bq  about 250 kg of technetium99 was released into the environment up to 1994 by atmospheric nuclear tests
========
as a result of nuclear fuel reprocessing technetium has been discharged into the sea in a number of locations and some seafood contains tiny but measurable quantities  for example  lobster  from west  cumbria  contains small amounts of technetium  the  anaerobic   spore forming  bacteria  in the  clostridium   genus  are able to reduce tcvii to tciv  clostridia bacteria play a role in reducing iron  manganese  and  uranium  thereby affecting these elements solubility in soil and sediments  their ability to reduce technetium may determine a large part of tcs mobility in industrial wastes and other subsurface environments
========
the long halflife of technetium99 and its ability to form an  anionic  species makes it along with  sup129supi  a major concern when considering longterm disposal of highlevel radioactive waste in addition many of the processes designed to remove fission products from mediumactive process streams in reprocessing plants are designed to remove  cationic  species like  caesium  eg  sup137supcs  and  strontium  eg  sup90supsr  hence the pertechnetate is able to escape through these treatment processes current disposal options favor  burial in geologically stable rock   the primary danger with such a course is that the waste is likely to come into contact with water which could leach radioactive contamination into the environment the anionic pertechnetate and  iodide  are less able to absorb onto the surfaces of minerals so they are likely to be more mobile
========
by comparison  plutonium   uranium  and  caesium  are much more able to bind to soil particles for this reason the environmental chemistry of technetium is an active area of research an alternative disposal method  transmutation  has been demonstrated at  cern  for technetium99 this transmutation process is one in which the technetium 99tc as a  metal  target is bombarded with  neutrons  to form the shortlived 100tc half life  16 seconds which decays by  beta decay  to  ruthenium  100ru if recovery of usable ruthenium is a goal an extremely pure technetium target is needed if small traces of the  minor actinides  such as  americium  and  curium  are present in the target they are likely to undergo fission and form more  fission products  which increase the radioactivity of the irradiated target the formation of 106ru half life 374 days from the fresh fission is likely to increase the activity of the final ruthenium metal which will then require a longer cooling time after irradiation before the  ruthenium  can be used
========
the actual production of technetium99 from spent nuclear fuel is a long process  during fuel reprocessing it appears in the waste liquid which is highly radioactive  after sitting for several years the radioactivity has fallen to a point where extraction of the longlived isotopes including technetium99 becomes feasible  several chemical extraction processes are used yielding technetium99 metal of high purity
========
the  meta stable  a state where the nucleus is in an excited state isotope 99mtc is produced as a  fission product  from the fission of  uranium  or  plutonium  in  nuclear reactors  because used fuel is allowed to stand for several years before reprocessing all 99mo and 99mtc will have decayed by the time that the fission products are separated from the  major actinides  in conventional nuclear reprocessing the purex  raffinate  will contain a high concentration of technetium as tco4 but almost all of this will be 99tc the vast majority of the 99mtc used in medical work is formed from 99mo which is formed by the  neutron  activation of 98mo 99mo has a halflife of 67 hours so shortlived 99mtc halflife 6 hours which results from its decay is being constantly produced  the hospital then chemically extracts the technetium from the solution by using a  technetium99m generator  technetium cow also occasionally called a molybdenum cow
========
the normal technetium cow is an  alumina  column which contains molybdenum98 inasmuch as aluminium has a small neutron cross section it is convenient for an alumina column bearing inactive 98mo to be irradiated with neutrons to make the radioactive mo99 column for the technetium cow by working in this way there is no need for the complex chemical steps which would be required to separate molybdenum from a fission product mixture this alternative method requires that an enriched  uranium  target be irradiated with  neutrons  to form 99mo as a  fission product  then separated
========
other technetium isotopes are not produced in significant quantities by fission when needed they are manufactured by neutron irradiation of parent isotopes for example 97tc can be made by neutron irradiation of 96ru
========

technetium is one of the two elements in the first 82 that have no stable  isotopes  in fact it is the lowestnumbered element that is exclusively radioactive the other such element is  promethium  the most stable  radioisotopes  are 98tc  halflife  of 42  ma  97tc halflife 26 ma and 99tc halflife 2111  ka
========
twentytwo other radioisotopes have been characterized with  atomic masses  ranging from 87933  u  88tc to 112931 u 113tc most of these have halflives that are less than an hour the exceptions are 93tc halflife 275 hours 94tc halflife 4883 hours 95tc halflife 20 hours and 96tc halflife 428 days
========
technetium also has numerous  meta states   97mtc is the most stable with a halflife of 901 days 0097 mev this is followed by 95mtc half life 61 days 0038 mev and 99mtc halflife 601 hours 0143 mev 99mtc only emits  gamma rays  subsequently decaying to 99tc
