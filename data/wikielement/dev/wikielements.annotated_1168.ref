tungsten is a metal with a wide range of uses the largest of which is as  tungsten carbide  w2 c  wc in cemented  carbides  cemented carbides also called hardmetals are wearresistant materials used by the metalworking  mining   petroleum  and construction industries  tungsten is widely used in  light bulb  and  vacuum tube  filaments as well as  electrodes  because it can be drawn into very thin wire with a high melting point  other uses
its high melting point makes tungsten suitable for aerospace and high temperature uses which include electrical heating and welding applications notably in the  gtaw  process also called  tig  welding
hardness and density properties make this metal ideal for making  heavy metal   alloys  that are used in armament  heat sinks  and high density applications such as weights counterweights ballast keels for yachts and tail ballast for commercial aircraft
the high  density  makes it an ideal ingredient for  darts  normally 80 and sometimes up to 97  this allows darts containing tungsten to have a smaller diameter than those of other metals at the same weight permitting tighter groupings
 high speed steel  contains tungsten and some tungsten steels contain as much as 18 tungsten
 superalloys  containing tungsten are used in  turbine  blades and wear resistant parts and coatings  examples are  hastelloy  and  stellite
tungsten powder is used as a filler material in  plastic  composites which are used as a nontoxic substitute for  lead  in  bullets  shot and radiation shields
tungsten chemical compounds are used in  catalysts  inorganic pigments and tungsten disulfide hightemperature  lubricants  which are stable to 500nbspc 930nbspf
since this elements thermal expansion is similar to  borosilicate glass  it is used for making glasstometal seals
it is used in  kinetic energy penetrators  usually alloyed with nickel and iron or cobalt to form heavy alloys used as an alternative to  depleted uranium
tungsten is used as an interconnect material in integrated circuits  contact holes are etched in silicon dioxide dielectric material filled with tungsten and polished to form connections to transistors  typical contact holes can be as small as 65 nm
 tungsten carbide  is one of the hardest  carbides  and is used in machine tools such as make  milling  and  turning  tools and used together with cobalt and carbon is often the best choice for such applications
used extensively for shielding in the  radiopharmaceutical  industry  it is often employed when transporting individual  fdg  doses called pigs  the high energy of  fluorine18  makes lead much less effective
tungsten is used in the emitters of  focused ion beam  and  electron microscopes
tungsten is also beginning to be used in jewelry its hardness makes it ideal for  rings  that will never scratch are  hypoallergenic  and will not need polishing this property is especially useful in designs with a brushed finish
also used in fishing lures like the  mormyshka
tungsten is used as ballast in high level race cars in series such as  nascar  and  formula 1
========
miscellaneous oxides are used in  ceramic  glazes and  calcium  magnesium  tungstates are used widely in fluorescent lighting crystal tungstates are used as  scintillation detectors  in  nuclear physics  and  nuclear medicine  the metal is also used in  xray  targets and heating elements for electrical furnaces salts that contain tungsten are used in the chemical and  tanning  industries tungsten bronzes socalled due to the colour of the tungsten oxides along with other compounds are used in  paints  some types of  strings  for musical instruments are wound with tungsten wire

tungsten is found in the  minerals   wolframite   iron  manganese  tungstate few o 4mnwo4  scheelite   calcium  tungstate cawo4   ferberite  and  hübnerite  there are major deposits of these minerals in  china  with about 57 world share  russia   austria  and  portugal  reports the  british geological survey  the metal is commercially produced by reducing tungsten oxide with hydrogen or  carbon
========
world tungsten reserves have been estimated at 7 million t w many of these reserves are not economically viable at this time at current rates of consumption these reserves will last for approximately 140 years it is estimated that 30 of the reserves are wolframite and 70 are scheelite ores another factor that controls the tungsten supply is scrap recycling of tungsten which is more readily refined for reuse than raw ore
========
tungsten  swedish  tung sten meaning heavy stone even though the current name for the element in swedish is wolfram sometimes spelled in swedish as volfram from the denomination volf rahm by  wallerius  in 1747 translated from the description by  agricola  in 1546 as lupi spuma meaning wolfs froth after the way tin is eaten up like a wolf after sheep in the process of its extraction
========
it was first hypothesized to exist by  peter woulfe  in 1779 who examined  wolframite  and concluded that it must contain a new substance in 1781  carl wilhelm scheele  ascertained that a new  acid  could be made from tungstenite scheele and  torbern bergman  suggested that it could be possible to obtain a new metal by reducing tungstic acid in 1783  josé  and  fausto elhuyar  found an acid in wolframite that was identical to tungstic acid in  spain  later that year the brothers succeeded in isolating tungsten through reduction of this acid with  charcoal  they are credited with the discovery of the element
========
in world war ii tungsten played an enormous role in background political dealings  portugal  as the main european source of the element was put under pressure from both sides because of its sources of wolframite ore the resistance to high temperatures as well as the extreme strength of its alloys made the metal into a very important raw material for the weaponry industry

thulium    is a  chemical element  that has the symbol tm and  atomic number  69  a  lanthanide  element thulium is the least abundant of the  rare earths   it is an easily workable  metal  with a bright silverygray luster and can be cut by a knife it has some  corrosion  resistance in dry air and good  ductility  naturally occurring thulium is made entirely of the  stable isotope  tm169
========
thulium has been used to create laser light but high production costs have prevented other commercial uses from being developed other applications real and potential
when stable thulium tm169 is bombarded in a  nuclear reactor  it can later serve as a  radiation  source in portable  xray  devices
the unstable isotope tm171 could possibly be used as an energy source
tm169 has potential use in ceramic magnetic materials called  ferrites  which are used in  microwave  equipment
========
thulium was  discovered  by swedish chemist  per teodor cleve  in  1879  by looking for impurities in the  oxides  of other rare earth elements this was the same method  carl gustaf mosander  earlier used to discover some other rare earth elements cleve started by removing all of the known contaminants of  erbia   er 2 o 3 and upon additional processing obtained two new substances one brown and one green the brown substance turned out to be the oxide of the element  holmium  and was named  holmia  by cleve and the green substance was the oxide of an unknown element cleve named the oxide  thulia  and its element thulium after  thule  scandinavia
========
thulium was so rare that none of the early workers had enough of it to purify sufficiently to actually see the green color they had to be content with observing the strengthening of the two characteristic absorption bands as erbium was progressively removed  the first researcher to obtain thulium nearly pure was the british expatriate working on a large scale at new hampshire college in durham nh charles james in 1911 he reported his results having used his discovered method of bromate fractional crystallization to do the purification  he famously needed 15000 operations to establish that the material was homogeneous
========
the element is never found in nature in pure form but it is found in small quantities in  minerals  with other rare earths it is principally extracted from  monazite  0007 thulium ores found in river sands through  ionexchange  newer ionexchange and solvent extraction techniques have led to easier separation of the rare earths which has yielded much lower costs for thulium production the principal source today are the ion adsorption clays of southern china  in the versions of these where about twothirds of the total rare earth content is yttrium thulium is about 05 or about tied with lutetium for rarity the metal can be isolated through  reduction  of its  oxide  with  lanthanum  metal or by  calcium  reduction in a closed container none of thuliums  compounds  are commercially important
