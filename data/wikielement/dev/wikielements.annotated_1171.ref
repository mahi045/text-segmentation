tantalum    formerly tantalium    is a  chemical element  with the symbol ta and  atomic number  73 a rare hard bluegray  lustrous   transition metal  tantalum is highly corrosionresistant and occurs naturally in the  mineral   tantalite
========
tantalum is  dark  dense ductile very hard easily fabricated and highly conductive of heat and electricity the metal is renowned for its resistance to  corrosion  by  acids  in fact at temperatures below 150nbsp c  tantalum is almost completely immune to attack by the normally aggressive  aqua regia  it can be dissolved with  hydrofluoric acid  or acidic solutions containing the  fluoride  ion and  sulfur trioxide  as well as with a solution of  potassium hydroxide  tantalums high melting point of 3017nbspc boiling point 5458nbspc is exceeded only by  tungsten  and  rhenium  for metals and  carbon
========
the major use for tantalum as the metal powder is in the production of electronic components mainly capacitors and some highend audiograde resistors  tantalum electrolytic capacitors exploit the tendency of tantalum to form a protective oxide surface layer using tantalum powder pressed into a pellet shape as one plate of the capacitor the oxide as the dielectric and an electrolytic solution or conductive solid as the other plate  because the dielectric layer can be very thin thinner than the similar layer in for instance an aluminium electrolytic capacitor a high capacitance can be achieved in a small volume  because of the size and weight advantages tantalum capacitors are attractive for portable telephones pagerspersonal computers and automotive electronics
========
tantalum is also used to produce a variety of alloys that have high melting points are strong and have good ductility  alloyed with other metals it is also used in making carbide tools for metalworking equipment and in the production of superalloys for jet engine components chemical process equipment  nuclear reactors  and missile parts  because of its ductility tantalum can be drawn into fine wires or filaments which are used for evaporating metals such as aluminium
========
due to the fact that it resists attack by body fluids and is nonirritating tantalum is widely used in making surgical instruments and implants  for example porous tantalum coatings are used in the construction of orthopedic implants due to tantalums ability to form a direct bond to hard tissue  the oxide is used to make special high  refractive index   glass  for  camera  lenses the metal is also used to make  vacuum furnace  parts
========
 shaped charge  liners have been constructed from tantalum
========
tantalum was discovered in  sweden  in  1802  by  anders ekeberg  and isolated in  1820  by  j√∂ns berzelius   many contemporary chemists believed  niobium  and tantalum were the same elements until  1844  and later  1866  when researchers showed that niobic and tantalic acids were different compounds early investigators were only able to isolate impure metal and the first relatively pure ductile metal was produced by  werner von bolton  in  1903  wires made with tantalum metal were used for  light bulbs  until  tungsten  replaced it
========
its name is derived from the character  tantalus  father of  niobe  in  greek mythology  who was punished after death by being condemned to stand kneedeep in water with perfect fruit growing above his head both of which eternally tantalized him  if he bent to drink the water it drained below the level he could reach and if he reached for the fruit the branches moved out of his grasp this was considered similar to tantalums general nonreactivitymdashit sits among reagents and is unaffected by them the english word  tantalize  was named after tantalus and tantalum was named after the tantalizing problems posed by the inertness of the element and its compounds
========
for many years the commercial technology for separating tantalum from niobium involved the fractional crystallization of potassium heptafluorotantalate away from potassium oxypentafluoroniobate monohydrate that had been discovered by marignac in the 1860s  the method has been supplanted by solvent extraction from fluoridecontaining solutions
========
tantalum occurs principally in the minerals  tantalite     fe   mn  ta2 o 6   microlite   and  euxenite  other minerals  samarskite  and  fergusonite
========
tantalum  ores  are mined in  ethiopia   australia   brazil   egypt   canada  the  democratic republic of the congo   mozambique   nigeria   namibia   portugal   malaysia  and  thailand   a comprehensive 2002  picture  of nonaustralian mines is reasonably current
