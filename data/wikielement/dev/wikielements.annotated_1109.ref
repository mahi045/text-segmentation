sulfur or sulphur     see spelling below  is the  chemical element  that has the symbol s and  atomic number  16 it is an abundant tasteless  multivalent   nonmetal   sulfur  in its native form  is a yellow crystalline solid  in  nature   it can be found as the pure element and as  sulfide  and  sulfate  minerals  it is an essential element for life and is found in two  amino acids   cysteine  and  methionine  its commercial uses are primarily in  fertilizers  but it is also widely used in  gunpowder   matches   insecticides  and  fungicides   elemental sulfur crystals are commonly sought after by mineral collectors for their brightly colored  polyhedron  shapes

========
sulfur  sanskrit  sulvari  latin  sulfur or sulpur was known in ancient times and is referred to in the  biblical   pentateuch   genesis
========
english translations of the bible commonly referred to sulfur as brimstone giving rise to the name of  fire and brimstone   sermons  in which listeners are reminded of the fate of eternal damnation that awaits the unbelieving and unrepentant it is from this part of the bible that  hell  is implied to smell of sulfur although as mentioned above sulfur is in fact odorless  the smell of sulfur usually refers to either the odor of  hydrogen sulfide  eg from rotten eggs or of burning sulfur which produces  sulfur dioxide  the smell associated with burnt matches
========
sulfur was known in  china  since the 6th century bc in a natural form that the chinese had called brimstone or shiliuhuang that was found in  hanzhong  by the 3rd century the chinese discovered that sulfur could be extracted from  pyrite
========
in the late 1770s  antoine lavoisier  helped convince the scientific community that sulfur was an element and not a compound in 1867 sulfur was discovered in underground deposits in  louisiana  and  texas  the overlying layer of earth was  quicksand  prohibiting ordinary mining operations therefore the  frasch process  was used
========
the element has traditionally been spelled sulphur in the  united kingdom   ireland   hong kong  the  commonwealth caribbean  and  india  but sulfur in the  united states  while both spellings are used in  australia   new zealand  and  canada   iupac  adopted the spelling sulfur in 1990 as did the  royal society of chemistry  nomenclature committee in 1992 and the  qualifications and curriculum authority  for england and wales recommended its use in 2000  the spelling of the term in nonofficial texts is gradually becoming uniform as sulfur
========
in latin the word is variously written sulpur sulphur and sulfur the oxford latin dictionary lists the spellings in this order  it is an original latin name and not a  classical greek  loan so the ph variant does not denote the greek letter φ sulfur in greek is theion θεῖον whence comes the prefix  thio   the simplification of the latin words p or ph to an f appears to have taken place towards the end of the classical period with the f spelling becoming dominant in the medieval period
========

sulfur has 18  isotopes  four of which are stable 32s 9502 33s 075 34s 421 and 36s 002 other than 35s the  radioactive isotopes  of sulfur are all short lived 35s is formed from  cosmic ray   spallation  of 40 argon  in the  atmosphere  it has a  halflife  of 87 days
========
when sulfide  minerals  are precipitated isotopic equilibration among solids and liquid may cause small differences in the δs34 values of cogenetic minerals the differences between minerals can be used to estimate the temperature of equilibration the δ c 13 and δs34 of coexisting  carbonates  and sulfides can be used to determine the  ph  and  oxygen   fugacity  of the orebearing fluid during ore formation
========
in most  forest  ecosystems sulfate is derived mostly from the atmosphere weathering of ore minerals and evaporites also contribute some sulfur sulfur with a distinctive isotopic composition has been used to identify pollution sources and enriched sulfur has been added as a tracer in  hydrologic  studies differences in the  natural abundances  can also be used in systems where there is sufficient variation in the 34s of ecosystem components  rocky mountain  lakes thought to be dominated by atmospheric sources of sulfate have been found to have different δs34 values from lakes believed to be dominated by watershed sources of sulfate
========

sulfur forms more than 30 solid  allotropes  more than than any other element besides s8 several other rings are known removing one atom from the crown gives s7 which is more deeply yellow than s8  hplc  analysis of elemental sulfur reveals an equilibrium mixture of mainly s8 but also s7 and small amounts of s6  larger rings have been prepared including s12 and s18 by contrast sulfurs lighter neighbor  oxygen  only exists in two states of allotropic significance o2 and o3  selenium  the heavier analogue of sulfur can form rings but is more often found as a polymer chain
========


elemental sulfur can be found near  hot springs  and  volcanic  regions in many parts of the world especially along the  pacific ring of fire   such volcanic deposits are currently mined in  indonesia   chile  and  japan   sicily  is also famous for its sulfur mines
========
significant deposits of elemental sulfur also exist in  salt domes  along the coast of the  gulf of mexico  and in  evaporites  in eastern europe and western asia  the sulfur in these deposits is believed to come from the action of  anaerobic bacteria  on  sulfate minerals  especially  gypsum  although apparently native sulfur may be produced by geological processes alone without the aid of living organisms see below however fossilbased sulfur deposits from salt domes are the basis for commercial production in the  united states   poland   russia   turkmenistan  and  ukraine
========
sulfur production through  hydrodesulfurization  of oil gas and the  athabasca oil sands  has produced a surplus  huge stockpiles of sulfur now exist throughout alberta canada
========
common naturally occurring sulfur compounds include the  sulfide minerals  such as  pyrite  iron sulfide  cinnabar  mercury sulfide  galena  lead sulfide  sphalerite  zinc sulfide and  stibnite  antimony sulfide and the sulfates such as gypsum calcium sulfate  alunite  potassium aluminium sulfate and  barite  barium sulfate  it occurs naturally in volcanic emissions such as from  hydrothermal vents  and from bacterial action on decaying sulfurcontaining organic matter
