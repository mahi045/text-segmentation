between 1900 and 1903  ernest rutherford  and  frederick soddy  showed how thorium decayed at a fixed rate over time into a series of other elements this observation led to the identification of  half life  as one of the outcomes of the  alpha particle  experiments that led to their disintegration theory of  radioactivity
========
the  crystal bar process  or iodide process was discovered by  anton eduard van arkel  and  jan hendrik de boer  in 1925 to produce highpurity metallic thorium
========
the name ionium was given early in the study of radioactive elements to the 230th  isotope  produced in the  decay chain  of  sup238supu  before it was realized that ionium and thorium were chemically identical  the symbol io was used for this supposed element

thorium is found in small amounts in most rocks and  soils  where it is about three times more abundant than  uranium  and is about as common as  lead  soil commonly contains an average of around 12 parts per million ppm of thorium thorium occurs in several  minerals  the most common being the rare earththoriumphosphate mineral  monazite  which contains up to about 12 thorium oxide there are substantial deposits in several countries 232th decays very slowly its  halflife  is about three times the age of the earth but other thorium  isotopes  occur in the thorium and  uranium  decay chains most of these are shortlived and hence much more radioactive than 232th though on a mass basis they are negligible india is believed to have 25 of the worlds thorium reserves

========
present knowledge of the distribution of thorium resources is poor because of the relatively lowkey exploration efforts arising out of insignificant demand  under the prevailing estimate  australia  and  india  have particularly large reserves of thorium
========
 the prevailing estimate of the economically available thorium reserves comes from the us geological survey mineral commodity summaries 19972006

========
 another estimate of reasonably assured reserves rar and estimated additional reserves ear of thorium comes from oecdnea nuclear energy trends in nuclear fuel cycle paris france 2001

the two sources vary wildly for countries such as brazil turkey and australia

thorium as well as  uranium  and  plutonium  can be used as fuel in a  nuclear reactor  although not  fissile  itself 232th will absorb  slow neutrons  to produce uranium233 233u which is fissile hence like 238u it is fertile
in one significant respect 233u is better than the other two fissile isotopes used for nuclear fuel 235u and plutonium239 239pu because of its higher neutron yield per neutron absorbed given a start with some other fissile material 235u or 239pu a breeding cycle similar to but more efficient than that currently possible with the 238uto239pu cycle in  slowneutron reactors  can be set up the 232th absorbs a neutron to become 233th which normally emits an  electron  and an  antineutrino   by  betasupminussup decay  to become  protactinium 233 233pa and then emits another electron and antineutrino by a second betaminus decay to become 233u

the irradiated fuel can then be unloaded from the reactor the 233u separated from the thorium a relatively simple process since it involves chemical instead of isotopic separation and fed back into another reactor as part of a closed  nuclear fuel cycle
========
problems include the high cost of fuel fabrication due partly to the high radioactivity of 233u which is a result of its contamination with traces of the shortlived 232u the similar problems in recycling thorium due to highly radioactive 228th some weapons proliferation risk of 233u and the technical problems not yet satisfactorily solved in reprocessing much development work is still required before the thorium fuel cycle can be commercialised and the effort required seems unlikely while or where abundant uranium is available
========
nevertheless the  thorium fuel cycle  with its potential for breeding fuel without  fast neutron reactors  holds considerable potential longterm benefits thorium is significantly more abundant than uranium and is a key factor in sustainable nuclear energy an example of this is the  liquid fluoride reactor
========
one of the earliest efforts to use thorium fuel cycle took place at oak ridge national laboratory in the 1960s an experimental reactor was built based on  molten salt reactor  technology to study the feasibility of such an approach  this effort culminated in a molten salt breeder reactor msbr design that used 232th as the fertile material and 233u as the fissile fuel due to a lack of funding the msbr program was discontinued in 1976

in 2007  norway  was debating whether or not to focus on thorium plants due to the existence of large deposits of thorium ores in the country particularly at  fensfeltet  near ulefoss in  telemark  county

naturally occurring thorium is composed of one  isotope   sup232supth  twentyseven  radioisotopes  have been characterized with the most abundant andor stable being 232th with a  halflife  of 1405 billion years 230th with a halflife of 75380 years 229th with a halflife of 7340 years and 228th with a halflife of 192 years  all of the remaining  radioactive  isotopes have halflives that are less than thirty days and the majority of these have halflives that are less than ten minutes  one isotope 229th has a  nuclear isomer  or metastable state with a remarkably low excitation energy of 35 ev
