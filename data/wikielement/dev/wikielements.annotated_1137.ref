========
commercial 992 pure grades of titanium have ultimate  tensile strength  of about 63000nbsp psi  434nbsp mpa  equal to that of some steel alloys but are 45 lighter
however titanium loses strength when heated above 430nbspc 800nbspf
========
it is fairly hard although not as hard as some grades of heattreated steel and is difficult to machine as it will  gall  if sharp tools and proper cooling methods are not used like those made from steel titanium structures have a  fatigue limit  which guarantees longevity in some applications
========
the metal is a dimorphic  allotrope  with the hexagonal alpha form changing into the bodycentered cubic lattice beta form at 882nbspc 1619nbspf
========
the most noted chemical property of titanium is its excellent resistance to  corrosion  it is almost as resistant as  platinum  capable of withstanding attack by  acids  moist  chlorine  gas and by common  salt  solutions
========
while the following  pourbaix diagram  shows that titanium is thermodynamically a very reactive metal it is slow to react with water and air
========

========
this metal forms a  passive  and protective  oxide  coating leading to increased corrosionresistance when exposed to elevated temperatures in air but at room temperatures it resists  tarnishing
========
titanium burns when heated in air 610nbspc 1130nbspf or higher forming titanium dioxide titanium is resistant to dilute  sulfuric  and  hydrochloric acid  along with  chlorine  gas  chloride  solutions and most  organic acids
========
experiments have shown that natural titanium becomes  radioactive  after it is bombarded with  deuterons  emitting mainly  positrons  and hard  gamma rays

========
titanium is always bonded to other elements in nature it is the ninthmost abundant element in the  earth s crust 063 by  mass  in fact of the 801 types of igneous rocks analyzed by the  united states geological survey  784 contained titanium
========
it is widely distributed and occurs primarily in the  minerals   anatase   brookite   ilmenite   perovskite   rutile   titanite  sphene as well in many  iron  ores of these minerals only rutile and ilmenite have any economic importance yet even they are difficult to find in high concentrations
========
titanium is contained in  meteorites  and has been detected in the  sun  and in  mtype   stars
========

========
the processing of titanium metal occurs in 4 major steps reduction of titanium ore into sponge a porous form melting of sponge or sponge plus a master alloy to form an ingot primary fabrication where an ingot is converted into general mill products such as billet bar plate sheet strip and tube and secondary fabrication of finished shapes from mill products
========
because the metal reacts with oxygen at high temperatures it cannot be produced by  reduction  of its dioxide titanium metal is therefore produced commercially by the  kroll process  a complex and expensive  batch process  the relatively high market value of titanium is mainly due to its processing which sacrifices another expensive metal magnesium
========
a more recently developed method the  ffc cambridge process  may eventually replace the kroll process this method uses  titanium dioxide  powder which is a refined form of  rutile  as feedstock to make the end product which is either a powder or sponge if mixed oxide powders are used the product is an alloy manufactured at a much lower cost than the conventional multistep melting process the ffc cambridge process may render titanium a less rare and expensive material for the  aerospace  industry and the luxury goods market and could be seen in many products currently manufactured using  aluminium  and specialist grades of  steel
========
common titanium  alloys  are made by reduction for example cuprotitanium rutile with  copper  added is reduced ferrocarbon titanium  ilmenite  reduced with  coke  in an electric furnace and manganotitanium  rutile  with manganese or manganese oxides are reduced
========
about 50 grades of titanium and titanium alloys are designated and currently used although only a couple of dozen are readily available commercially the  astm international  recognizes 31 grades of titanium metal and alloys of which grades 1 through 4 are commercially pure unalloyed these four are distinguished by their varying degrees of tensile strength as a function of  oxygen  content with grade 1 being the most ductile lowest tensile strength with an oxygen content of 018 and grade 4 the least highest tensile strength with an oxygen content of 040
