before the element was discovered many of the properties of element 43  were predicted  by  dmitri mendeleev   mendeleev noted a gap in his  periodic table  and called the element ekamanganese  in 1937 its isotope 97tc became the first predominantly artificial element to be produced hence its name from the  greek  τεχνητός meaning artificial  most technetium produced on earth is a byproduct of  fission  of  uranium235  in  nuclear reactors  and is extracted from  nuclear fuel rods  no isotope of technetium has a  halflife  longer than 42 million years 98tc so its detection in  red giants  in 1952 helped bolster the theory that stars can produce heavier elements  on earth technetium occurs in trace but measurable quantities as a product of  spontaneous fission  in uranium ore or by  neutron capture  in  molybdenum  ores
========
technetium is a silverygrey radioactive  metal  with an appearance similar to  platinum  however it is commonly obtained as a grey powder its position in the periodic table is between  rhenium  and  manganese  and as predicted by the  periodic law  its properties are intermediate between those two elements technetium is unusual among the lighter elements in that it has no stable  isotopes  only technetium and  promethium  have no stable isotopes but are followed by elements which do
========
technetium is therefore extremely rare on  earth  technetium plays no natural biological role and is not normally found in the  human  body
========
the metal form of technetium slowly  tarnishes  in moist air its  oxides  are tc o 2 and tc2o7 under oxidizing conditions technetium vii will exist as the  pertechnetate   ion  tco4  common  oxidation states  of technetium include 0 2 4 5 6 and 7 technetium will burn in  oxygen  when in powder form it dissolves in  aqua regia   nitric acid  and concentrated  sulfuric acid  but it is not soluble in  hydrochloric acid   it has characteristic  spectral lines  at 363  nm  403 nm 410 nm 426 nm 430 nm and 485 nm
========
the metal form is slightly  paramagnetic  meaning its  magnetic dipoles  align with external  magnetic fields  even though technetium is not normally magnetic the  crystal structure  of the metal is  hexagonal   closepacked   pure metallic singlecrystal technetium becomes a type ii  superconductor  at 746  k  irregular crystals and trace impurities raise this temperature to 112 k for 999 pure technetium powder below this temperature technetium has a very high  magnetic penetration depth  the largest among the elements apart from  niobium
========
technetium is produced in quantity by nuclear fission and spreads more readily than many radionuclides in spite of the importance of understanding its toxicity in animals and humans experimental evidence is scant  it appears to have low chemical toxicity its radiological toxicity per unit of mass is a function of compound type of radiation for the isotope in question and the isotope halflife  technetium99m  is particularly attractive for medical applications as the radiation from this isotope is a gamma ray with the same wavelength as xrays used for common medical diagnostic xray applications giving it adequate penetration while causing minimal damage for a gamma photon this plus the extremely short halflife of this metastable  nuclear isomer  followed by the relatively long halflife of the daughter isotope tc99 which allows it to be eliminated from the body before it decays this leads to a relatively low dose of administered radiation in biologically doseequivalent amounts  sieverts  for a typical tc99m based nuclear scan see more on this subject below
========
all isotopes of technetium must be handled carefully the most common isotope technetium99 is a weak beta emitter such radiation is stopped by the walls of laboratory glassware soft  xrays  are emitted when the beta particles are stopped but as long as the body is kept more than 30 cm away these should pose no problem  the primary hazard when working with technetium is inhalation of dust such  radioactive contamination  in the lungs can pose a significant cancer risk  for most work careful handling in a  fume hood  is sufficient a  glove box  is not needed
========
99mtc m indicates that this is a  metastable   nuclear isomer  is used in radioactive isotope  medical tests  for example as a  radioactive tracer  that medical equipment can detect in the body  it is well suited to the role because it emits readily detectable 140  kev   gamma rays  and its halflife is 601 hours meaning that about fifteen sixteenths of it decays to 99tc in 24 hours klaus schwochaus book technetium lists 31  radiopharmaceuticals  based on 99mtc for imaging and functional studies of the  brain   myocardium   thyroid   lungs   liver   gallbladder   kidneys   skeleton   blood  and  tumors
========
 immunoscintigraphy  incorporates 99mtc into a  monoclonal antibody  an  immune system   protein  capable of binding to  cancer  cells a few hours after injection medical equipment is used to detect the gamma rays emitted by the 99mtc higher concentrations indicate where the tumor is this technique is particularly useful for detecting hardtofind cancers such as those affecting the  intestine  these modified antibodies are sold by the german company  hoechst  now part of  sanofiaventis  under the name  scintium
========
when 99mtc is combined with a  tin  compound it binds to  red blood cells  and can therefore be used to map  circulatory system  disorders it is commonly used to detect gastrointestinal bleeding sites a  pyrophosphate  ion with 99mtc adheres to  calcium  deposits in damaged  heart  muscle making it useful to gauge damage after a  heart attack  the  sulfur  colloid of 99mtc is scavenged by the  spleen  making it possible to image the structure of the spleen
========
 radiation exposure  due to diagnostic treatment involving tc99m can be kept low because 99mtc has a short halflife and high energy gamma allowing small amounts to be easily detected its quick decay into the farless radioactive 99tc results in relatively less total radiation dose to the patient per unit of initial activity after administration in the form administered in these medical tests usually pertechnetate both isotopes are quickly eliminated from the body generally within a few days
========
technetium for nuclear medicine purposes is usually extracted from  technetium99m generators  95mtc with a halflife of 61 days is used as a  radioactive tracer  to study the movement of technetium in the environment and in plant and animal systems
========
technetium99 decays almost entirely by  beta decay  emitting beta particles with consistent low energies and no accompanying  gamma rays   moreover its long halflife means that this emission decreases very slowly with time  it can also be extracted to a high chemical and isotopic purity from radioactive waste  for these reasons it is a  nist  standard beta emitter used for equipment calibration
========
technetium99 has also been proposed for use in optoelectric and  nanoscale   nuclear batteries
========
like  rhenium  and  palladium  technetium can serve as a catalyst  for certain reactions for example the  dehydrogenation  of  isopropyl alcohol  it is a far more effective catalyst than either rhenium or palladium  of course its radioactivity is a major problem in finding safe applications
========
under certain circumstances a small concentration 5105  mol  l  of the pertechnetate ion in water can protect iron and carbon steels from corrosion for this reason pertechnetate could find use as an anodic  corrosion  inhibitor for  steel  although technetiums radioactivity poses problems for strictly chemical uses such as these while for example cro42 can also inhibit corrosion it requires a concentration ten times as high  in one experiment a test specimen was kept in an aqueous solution of pertechnetate for 20 years and was still uncorroded  the mechanism by which pertechnetate prevents corrosion is not wellunderstood but seems to involve the reversible formation of a thin surface layer one theory holds that the pertechnetate reacts with the steel surface to form a layer of technetium  dioxide  which prevents further corrosion the same effect explains how iron powder can be used to remove pertechnetate from water  activated carbon  can also be used for the same effect the effect disappears rapidly if the concentration of pertechnetate falls below the minimum concentration or if too high a concentration of other ions is added
========
as noted the radioactive nature of technetium 3 m bq  per liter at the concentrations required makes this corrosion protection impractical in almost all situations  nevertheless corrosion protection by pertechnetate ions was proposed but never adopted for use in  boiling water reactors
========

for a number of years there was a gap in the periodic table between  molybdenum  element 42 and  ruthenium  element 44 many early researchers were eager to be the first to discover and name the missing element its location in the table suggested that it should be easier to find than other undiscovered elements it was first thought to have been found in  platinum  ores in 1828 it was given the name  polinium  but it turned out to be impure  iridium  then in 1846 the element ilmenium was claimed to have been discovered but was determined to be impure  niobium  this mistake was repeated in 1847 with the discovery of pelopium  dmitri mendeleev  predicted that this missing element as part of other predictions would be chemically similar to  manganese  and gave it the name ekamanganese
========
in 1877 the russian chemist  serge kern  reported discovering the missing element in  platinum  ore kern named what he thought was the new element davyum after the noted english chemist sir  humphry davy  but it was determined to be a mixture of iridium rhodium and  iron  another candidate lucium followed in 1896 but it was determined to be  yttrium  then in 1908 the japanese chemist  masataka ogawa  found evidence in the mineral  thorianite  which he thought indicated the presence of element 43 ogawa named the element nipponium after  japan  which is nippon in japanese in 2004 h k yoshihara utilized a record of xray spectrum of ogawas nipponium sample from thorianite  which  was contained in a photographic plate preserved by his family the spectrum was read and indicated the absence of the element 43 and the presence of the element 75 rhenium
