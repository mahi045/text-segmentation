powdered thorium metal is often  pyrophoric  and should be handled carefully
========
natural thorium decays very slowly compared to many other radioactive materials and the  alpha radiation  emitted cannot penetrate human skin owning and handling small amounts of thorium such as a  gas mantle  is considered safe if care is taken not to ingest the thorium  lungs and other internal organs can be penetrated by alpha radiation exposure to aerosolized thorium can lead to increased risk of  cancers  of the  lung   pancreas  and  blood  exposure to thorium internally leads to increased risk of  liver  diseases this element has no known biological role see also  thorotrast
========
thorium has been extracted chiefly from monazite through a multistage process in the first stage the monazite sand is dissolved in an inorganic acid such as sulfuric acid h2so4 in the second the thorium is extracted into an organic phase containing an amine  next it is separated or stripped using an anion such as nitrate chloride hydroxide or carbonate returning the thorium to an aqueous phase  finally the thorium is precipitated and collected

terbium    is a  chemical element  with the symbol tb and  atomic number  65
========
terbium is a silverywhite  rare earth   metal  that is  malleable   ductile  and soft enough to be cut with a knife it is reasonably stable in air and two crystal  allotropes  exist with a transformation temperature of 1289 c
terbiumiii cation is brilliantly  fluorescent  in a beautiful bright lemonyellow color that is the result of a strong green  emission line  in combination with other lines in the orange and red the  yttrofluorite  variety of the mineral  fluorite  owes its creamyyellow fluorescence in part to terbium
========
terbium is used to  dope   calcium fluoride  calcium  tungstate  and  strontium   molybdate  materials that are used in solidstate devices and as a crystal stabilizer of  fuel cells  which operate at elevated temperatures together with  zrosub2sub
========
terbium is also used in  alloys  and in the production of electronic devices as a component of  terfenold  an alloy that expands or contracts to a high degree in the presence of a magnetic field terbium is of use in   actuators   sensors  and other magenetomechanical devices
========
terbium  oxide  is used in green  phosphors  in  fluorescent lamps  and color tv tubes  sodium  terbium  borate  is used in  solid state  devices the brilliant fluorescence allows terbium to be used as a probe in biochemistry where it somewhat resembles  calcium  in its behavior terbium green phosphors which fluoresce a brilliant lemonyellow are combined with divalent  europium  blue phosphors and trivalent europium red phosphors to provide the trichromatic lighting technology which is by far the largest consumer of the worlds terbium supply trichromatic lighting provides much higher light output for a given amount of electrical energy than does  incandescent lighting
========
terbium was discovered in  1843  by  swedish   chemist   carl gustaf mosander
who detected it as an impurity in  yttrium oxide y2o3 and named after the village  ytterby  in  sweden  it was not isolated in pure form until the recent advent of  ion exchange  techniques
when mosander first partitioned yttria into three fractions terbia was the fraction that contained the pink color due to what is now known as erbium and erbia was the fraction that was essentially colorless in solution but gave a browntinged oxide  later workers had difficulty in observing the latter but the pink fraction was impossible to miss arguments went back and forth as to whether erbia even existed in the confusion the original names got reversed and the exchange of names stuck  it is now thought that those workers who used the double sodium or potassium sulfates to remove ceria from yttria inadvertently lost the terbium content of the system into the ceriacontaining precipitate  in any case what is now known as terbium was only about 1 of the original yttria but that was sufficient to impart a yellowish color to the oxide thus terbium was a minor component in the original terbium fraction dominated by its immediate neighbors gadolinium and dysprosium thereafter whenever other rare earths were teased apart from this mixture whichever fraction gave the brown oxide retained the terbium name until at last it was pure the 19th century investigators did not have the benefit of fluorescence technology wherewith to observe the brilliant fluorescence that would have made this element much easier to track in mixtures
========
terbium is classified as a  rare earth element  the term rare is misleading because terbium is more common than metals such as silver and mercury the name rare earth meant something else to early chemists it was used because the rare earth elements were very difficult to separate from each other they were not rare in the earth but they were rarely used for anything also it was initially believed that they were rare but actually it was later discovered that it wasnt the case
========
terbium is never found in nature as a free element but it is contained in many  minerals  including  cerite   gadolinite   monazite  celathndypo4 which contains up to 003 of terbium  xenotime  ypo4 and  euxenite  ycaerlaceuthnbtati2o6 which contains 1 or more of terbium
the richest current commercial sources of terbium are the ionadsorption  clays  of  southern china   the highyttrium concentrate versions of these are about twothirds yttrium oxide by weight and about 1 terbia  however small amounts occur in  bastnaesite  and  monazite  and when these are processed by solventextraction to recover the valuable heavy lanthanides in the form of  samarium  europium  gadolinium  concentrate seg concentrate the terbium content of the ore ends up therein due to the large volumes of bastnaesite processed relative to the richer ionadsorption clays a significant proportion of the worlds terbium supply comes from bastnaesite
