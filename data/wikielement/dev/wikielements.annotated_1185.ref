all uranium fluorides are created using  uranium tetrafluoride        itself is prepared by hydrofluorination of uranium dioxide
========
at room temperatures    has a high  vapor pressure  making it useful in the  gaseous diffusion  process to separate highly valuable uranium235 from the far more common uranium238 isotope this compound can be prepared from uranium dioxide and uranium hydride by the following process
========
one method of preparing  uranium tetrachloride     is to directly combine  chlorine  with either uranium metal or uranium hydride the reduction of    by hydrogen produces uranium trichloride    while the higher chlorides of uranium are prepared by reaction with additional chlorine
========
 bromides  and  iodides  of uranium are formed by direct reaction of respectively  bromine  and  iodine  with uranium or by adding    to those elements acids

naturally occurring uranium is composed of three major  isotopes   uranium238  9928  natural abundance   uranium235  071 and  uranium234  00054 all three isotopes are  radioactive  creating  radioisotopes  with the most abundant and stable being uranium238 with a  halflife  of 451   years close to the  age of the earth  uranium235 with a halflife of 713   years and uranium234 with a halflife of 248   years
========
uranium238 is an Î± emitter decaying through the 18member uranium natural decay series into  lead206
========
the isotope uranium235 is important for both  nuclear reactors  and  nuclear weapons  because it is the only isotope existing in nature to any appreciable extent that is  fissile  that is can be broken apart by thermal neutrons
========


enrichment of uranium ore through  isotope separation  to concentrate the fissionable uranium235 is needed for use in nuclear weapons and most nuclear power plants with the exception of  pressurised heavy water reactors  a majority of neutrons released by a fissioning atom of uranium235 must impact other uranium235 atoms to sustain the  nuclear chain reaction  needed for these applications the concentration and amount of uranium235 needed to achieve this is called a critical mass
========
to be considered enriched the uranium235 fraction has to be increased to significantly greater than its concentration in naturallyoccurring uranium enriched uranium typically has a uranium235 concentration of between 3 and 5 the process produces huge quantities of uranium that is depleted of uranium235 and with a correspondingly increased fraction of uranium238 called  depleted uranium  or du to be considered depleted the uranium235 isotope concentration has to have been decreased to significantly less than its natural concentration typically the amount of uranium235 left in depleted uranium is 02 to 03 as the price of uranium has risen since 2001 some enrichment tailings containing more than 035 uranium235 are being considered for reenrichment driving the price of these depleted uranium hexafluoride stores above 130 per kilogram in july 2007 from just 5 in 2001
========
the  gas centrifuge  process where gaseous  uranium hexafluoride     is separated by the difference in molecular weight between 235uf6 and 238uf6 using highspeed  centrifuges  has become the cheapest and leading enrichment process lighter    concentrates in the center of the centrifuge the  gaseous diffusion  process was the previous leading method for enrichment and the one used in the  manhattan project  in this process uranium hexafluoride is repeatedly  diffused  through a  silver  zinc  membrane and the different isotopes of uranium are separated by diffusion rate uranium 238 is heavier and thus diffuses slightly slower than uranium235
========
a person can be exposed to uranium or its radioactive daughters such as  radon  by inhaling dust in air or by ingesting contaminated water and food the amount of uranium in air is usually very small however people who work in factories that process  phosphate   fertilizers  live near government facilities that made or tested nuclear weapons live or work near a modern battlefield where  depleted uranium   weapons  have been used or live or work near a  coal fired power plant facilities that mine or process uranium ore or enrich uranium for reactor fuel may have increased exposure to uranium houses or structures that are over uranium deposits either natural or manmade slag deposits may have an increased incidence of exposure to radon gas
========
almost all uranium that is ingested is excreted during  digestion  but up to 5 is absorbed by the body when the soluble  uranyl  ion is ingested while only 05 is absorbed when insoluble forms of uranium such as its oxide are ingested
========
the greatest health risk from large intakes of uranium is  toxic  damage to the  kidneys  because in addition to being weakly radioactive uranium is a  toxic metal  radiological effects are generally local because this is the nature of alpha radiation the primary form from u238 decay  no human  cancer  has been seen as a result of exposure to natural or depleted uranium but exposure to some of its decay products especially  radon  does pose a significant health threat
although accidental inhalation exposure to a high concentration of  uranium hexafluoride  has
resulted in human fatalities those deaths were not associated with uranium itself finelydivided uranium metal presents a fire hazard because uranium is  pyrophoric  so small grains will ignite spontaneously in air at room temperature
