========
 magnesium sulfate  better known as  epsom salts  can be used as a  laxative  a bath additive an  exfoliant  a  magnesium  supplement for plants or a  desiccant
========
sulfur is used as a lightgenerating medium in the rare lighting fixtures known as  sulfur lamps
========
in the late 18th century  furniture  makers used molten sulfur to produce decorative  inlays  in their craft  because of the  sulfur dioxide  produced during the process of melting sulfur the craft of sulfur inlays was soon abandoned molten sulfur is sometimes still used for setting steel bolts into drilled concrete holes where high shock resistance is desired for floormounted equipment attachment points  pure powdered sulfur was also used as a medicinal tonic and laxative
========
sulfur is an essential component of all living  cells
========
sulfur may also serve as chemical food source for some primitive organisms some forms of  bacteria  use  hydrogen sulfide  h2s in the place of water as the  electron  donor in a primitive  photosynthesis like process inorganic sulfur forms a part of  ironsulfur clusters  and sulfur is the bridging ligand in the  cu a site of  cytochrome c oxidase  a basic substance involved in utilization of oxygen by all aerobic life
========
sulfur is absorbed by  plants  via the  roots  from soil as the  sulfate   ion  and reduced to sulfide before it is incorporated into  cysteine  and other organic sulfur compounds  sulfur assimilation
========
in  plants  and  animals  the  amino acids   cysteine  and  methionine  contain sulfur as do all  polypeptides   proteins  and  enzymes  which contain these amino acids  homocysteine  and  taurine  are other sulfurcontaining acids which are similar in structure but which are not coded for by  dna  and are not part of the  primary structure  of proteins  glutathione  is an important sulfurcontaining tripeptide which plays a role in cells as a source of chemical reduction potential in the cell through its sulfhydryl sh moiety many important cellular enzymes use prosthetic groups ending with sh moieties to handle reactions involving acylcontaining biochemicals two common examples from basic metabolism are  coenzyme a  and  alphalipoic acid
========
 disulfide bonds  ss bonds formed between cysteine residues in peptide chains are very important in protein assembly and structure these strong covalent bonds between peptide chains give proteins a great deal of extra toughness and resiliency for example the high strength of feathers and hair is in part due to their high content of ss bonds and their high content of cysteine and sulfur eggs are high in sulfur because large amounts of the element are necessary for feather formation the high disulfide content of hair and feathers contributes to their indigestibility and also their odor when burned
========
in traditional medical skin treatment which predates modern era of scientific medicine elmental sulfur has been used mainly as part of cremes to alleviate various conditions such as psoriasis eczema  acne the mechanism of action is not known although elemental sulfur does oxidize slowly to sulfurous acid which in turn though the action of  sulfite  acts as a mild reducing and antibacterial agent
========
the burning of  coal  andor  petroleum  by industry and  power plants  generates  sulfur dioxide  s o 2 which reacts with atmospheric water and oxygen to produce  sulfuric acid  h2so4  this sulfuric acid is a component of  acid rain  which lowers the  ph  of  soil  and freshwater bodies sometimes resulting in substantial damage to the  natural environment  and  chemical weathering  of statues and structures  fuel standards increasingly require sulfur to be extracted from  fossil fuels  to prevent the formation of acid rain this extracted sulfur is then refined and represents a large portion of sulfur production in coal fired power plants the flue gases are sometimes purified in more modern power plants that use  syngas  the sulfur is extracted before the gas is burned
========
carbon disulfide carbon oxysulfide hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide should all be handled with care
========
although  sulfur dioxide  is sufficiently safe to be used as a  food additive  in small amounts at high concentrations it reacts with moisture to form  sulfurous acid  which in sufficient quantities may harm the  lungs   eyes  or other  tissues  in organisms without lungs such as insects or plants it otherwise prevents  respiration
========
 hydrogen sulfide  is  toxic   although very pungent at first it quickly deadens the sense of smell so potential victims may be unaware of its presence until death or other symptoms occur
