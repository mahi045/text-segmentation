sulfur is present in many types of  meteorites  ordinary chondrites contain on average 21 sulfur and carbonaceous chondrites may contain as much as 66 sulfur in meteorites is normally present entirely as troilite fes but other sulfides are found in some meteorites and carbonaceous chondrites contain free sulfur sulfates and possibly other sulfur compounds
========

at room temperature sulfur is a soft bright yellow solid  elemental sulfur has only a faint odor similar to that of  matches
the odor associated with rotten eggs is due to  hydrogen sulfide  h2s and organic sulfur compounds rather than elemental sulfur
sulfur burns with a blue flame that emits  sulfur dioxide  notable for its peculiar suffocating odor  sulfur is insoluble in water but  soluble  in  carbon disulfide  and to a lesser extent in other nonpolar organic solvents such as  benzene  and  toluene   common  oxidation states  of sulfur include minus2 2 4 and 6  sulfur forms stable compounds with all elements except the  noble gases
sulfur in the solid state ordinarily exists as cyclic crownshaped s8 molecules
========

the  crystallography  of sulfur is complex depending on the specific conditions the sulfur  allotropes  form several distinct  crystal structures  with  rhombic  and  monoclinic  s8 best known
========
a noteworthy property of sulfur is that its  viscosity  in its molten state unlike most other liquids increases above temperatures of 200 c due to the formation of  polymers   the molten sulfur assumes a dark red color above this temperature  at higher temperatures however the viscosity is decreased as depolymerization occurs
========
 amorphous  or plastic sulfur can be produced through the rapid cooling of molten sulfur  xray crystallography  studies show that the amorphous form may have a  helical  structure with eight atoms per turn this form is  metastable  at room temperature and gradually reverts back to crystalline form this process happens within a matter of hours to days but can be rapidly catalyzed
========
sulfur is extracted by mainly two processes the sicilian process and the  frasch process  the sicilian process which was first used in  sicily  was used in ancient times to get sulfur from rocks present in volcanic regions in this process the sulfur deposits are piled and stacked in brick kilns built on sloping hillsides and with airspaces between them then powdered sulfur is put on top of the sulfur deposit and ignited as the sulfur burns the heat melts the sulfur deposits causing the molten sulfur to flow down the sloping hillside the molten sulfur can then be collected in wooden buckets
========
the second process used to obtain sulfur is the frasch process in this method three concentric pipes are used the outermost pipe contains superheated water which melts the sulfur and the innermost pipe is filled with hot compressed air which serves to create foam and pressure the resulting sulfur foam is then expelled through the middle pipe
========
the frasch process produces sulfur with a 995 purity content and which needs no further purification the sulfur produced by the sicilian process must be purified by distillation
========
the  claus process  is used to extract elemental sulfur from  hydrogen sulfide  produced in  hydrodesulfurization  of petroleum or from  natural gas
========

 hydrogen sulfide  has the characteristic smell of rotten eggs dissolved in water hydrogen sulfide is acidic and will react with metals to form a series of metal sulfides natural metal sulfides are common especially those of iron iron sulfide is called  pyrite  the socalled fools gold pyrite can show semiconductor properties  galena  a naturally occurring lead sulfide was the first  semiconductor  discovered and found a use as a signal  rectifier  in the cats whiskers of early  crystal radios
========
many of the unpleasant odors of organic matter are based on sulfurcontaining compounds such as  methyl  and  ethyl mercaptan  also used to scent natural gas so that leaks are easily detectable the odor of  garlic  and  skunk  stink are also caused by sulfurcontaining organic compounds not all organic sulfur compounds smell unpleasant for example  grapefruit mercaptan  a sulfurcontaining  monoterpenoid  is responsible for the characteristic scent of grapefruit
========
polymeric sulfur nitride has metallic properties even though it does not contain any  metal  atoms this compound also has unusual electrical and optical properties this polymer can be made from  tetrasulfur tetranitride  s4n4
========
phosphorus sulfides are useful in synthesis  for example p4s10 and its derivatives  lawessons reagent  and  naphthalen18diyl 1324dithiadiphosphetane 24disulfide  are used to replace oxygen from some organic molecules with sulfur
========
inorganic sulfur compounds

  sulfides  s2 a complex family of compounds usually derived from s2   cadmium sulfide  cds is an example
  sulfites  so32 the salts of  sulfurous acid  h2so3 which is generated by dissolving so2 in water sulfurous acid and the corresponding sulfites are fairly strong reducing agents other compounds derived from so2 include the pyrosulfite or metabisulfite ion s2o52
  sulfates  so42 the salts of  sulfuric acid  sulfuric acid also reacts with so3 in equimolar ratios to form  pyrosulfuric acid  h2s2o7
  thiosulfates s2o32sometimes referred as thiosulfites or hyposulfites  thiosulfates are used in photographic fixing hypo as reducing agents  ammonium thiosulfate is being investigated as a  cyanide  replacement in leaching  gold
  sodium dithionite  na2s2o4 is the highly reducing dianion derived from hyposulfurousdithionous acid
  sodium dithionate  na2s2o6
  polythionic acids  h2sno6 where n can range from 3 to 80
  peroxymonosulfuric acid  h2so5 and  peroxydisulfuric acids  h2s2o8 made from the action of so3 on concentrated  hsub2subosub2sub  and  hsub2subsosub4sub  on concentrated h2o2 respectively
  sodium polysulfides  na2sx
  sulfur hexafluoride  sf6 a dense gas at ambient conditions is used as nonreactive and nontoxic propellant
 sulfur nitrides are chain and cyclic compounds containing only s and n   tetrasulfur tetranitride  s4n4 is an example
  thiocyanates  contain the scn group  oxidation of thiocyanoate gives  thiocyanogen  scn2 with the connectivity ncsscn
========
organic sulfur compounds where r r and r are organic groups such as ch3

  thioethers  have the form rsrprime  these compounds are the sulfur equivalents of  ethers
  sulfonium  ions have the formula rrsr ie where three groups are attached to the cationic sulfur center   dimethylsulfoniopropionate  dmsp  ch32sch2ch2coo is a sulfonium ion which is important in the marine organic  sulfur cycle
  thiols  also known as mercaptans have the form rsh  these are the sulfur equivalents of  alcohols
  thiolates  ions have the form rs  such anions arise upon treatment of  thiols  with base
  sulfoxides  have the form rsorprime a common sulfoxide is  dmso
  sulfones  have the form rso2rprime  a common sulfone is sulfolane c4h8so2

one of the direct uses of sulfur is in  vulcanization  of rubber where  polysulfides  crosslink organic polymers sulfur is a component of  gunpowder   it reacts directly with methane to give  carbon disulfide  which is used to manufacture  cellophane  and  rayon
========
elemental sulfur is mainly used as a precursor to other chemicals  approximately 85 1989 is converted to  sulfuric acid   h 2s o 4 which is of such prime importance to the  worlds economies  that the production and consumption of sulfuric acid is an indicator of a nations industrial development   for example more sulfuric acid is produced in the  united states  every year than any other industrial chemical  the principal use for the acid is the extraction of phosphate ores for the production of fertilizer manufacturing  other applications of sulfuric acid include oil refining wastewater processing and mineral extraction
========
sulfur compounds are also used in  detergents   fungicides   dyestuffs  and agrichemicals  in silverbased  photography  sodium and ammonium  thiosulfate  are used as fixing agents
