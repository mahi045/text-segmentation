as well as compounds where xenon forms a  chemical bond  xenon can form  clathrates mdashsubstances where xenon atoms are trapped by the  crystalline lattice  of another compound an example is  xenon hydrate  xemiddot575 h2o where xenon atoms occupy vacancies in a lattice of water molecules  the  deuterated  version of this hydrate has also been produced  such  clathrate hydrates  can occur naturally under conditions of high pressure
such as in  lake vostok  underneath the  antarctic  ice sheet  clathrate formation can be used to fractionally distill xenon argon and krypton
xenon can also form  endohedral fullerene  compounds where a xenon atom is trapped inside a  fullerene  molecule  the xenon atom trapped in the fullerene can be monitored via 129xe  nuclear magnetic resonance  spectroscopy using this technique chemical reactions on the fullerene molecule can be analyzed due to the sensitivity of the  chemical shift  of the xenon atom to its environment however the xenon atom also has an electronic influence on the reactivity of the fullerene

although xenon is rare and relatively expensive to extract from the  earths atmosphere  it still has a number of applications
========

xenon is used in lightemitting devices called  xenon flash lamps  which are used in  photographic flashes  and stroboscopic lamps to excite the  active medium  in  lasers  which then generate  coherent light   and occasionally in  bactericidal  lamps  the first solidstate  laser  invented in 1960 was pumped by a xenon flash lamp and lasers used to power  inertial confinement fusion  are also pumped by xenon flash lamps

continuous shortarc high pressure  xenon arc lamps  have a  color temperature  closely approximating noon sunlight and are used in solar simulators that is the  chromaticity  of these lamps closely approximates a heated  blackbody  radiator that has a temperature close to that observed from the sun after they were first introduced during the 1940s these lamps began replacing the shorterlived  carbon arc lamps  in movie projectors they are employed in typical  35mm  and  imax   film projection  systems automotive  hid  headlights and other specialized uses these arc lamps are an excellent source of short wavelength  ultraviolet  radiation and they have intense emissions in the near  infrared  which is used in some  night vision  systems
========
the individual cells in a  plasma display  use a mixture of xenon and neon that is converted into a  plasma  using  electrodes  the interaction of this plasma with the electrodes generates ultraviolet  photons  which then excite the  phosphor  coating on the front of the display
========
xenon is used as a starter gas in  high pressure sodium lamps  it has the lowest  thermal conductivity  and lowest  ionization potential  of all the nonradioactive noble gases as a noble gas it does not interfere with the chemical reactions occurring in the operating lamp the low thermal conductivity minimizes thermal losses in the lamp while in the operating state and the low ionization potential causes the  breakdown voltage  of the gas to be relatively low in the cold state which allows the lamp to be more easily started
========
in 1962 a group of researchers at  bell laboratories  discovered laser action in xenon and later found that the laser gain was improved by adding  helium  to the lasing medium  the first  excimer laser  used a xenon  dimer  xe2 energized by a beam of electrons to produce  stimulated emission  at an  ultraviolet  wavelength of 176  nm
xenon chloride and xenon fluoride have also been used in excimer or more accurately exciplex lasers the xenon chloride excimer laser has been employed for example in certain dermatological uses
========
xenon has been used as a  general anesthetic  although it is expensive even so anesthesia machines that can deliver xenon are about to appear on the european market two mechanisms for xenon anesthesia have been proposed the first one involves the inhibition of the  calcium atpase pump mdashthe mechanism cells use to remove calcium ca2mdashin the  cell membrane  of  synapses  this results from a  conformational change  when xenon binds to nonpolar sites inside the protein the second mechanism focuses on the nonspecific interactions between the anesthetic and the  lipid membrane
========
xenon has a  minimum alveolar concentration  mac of 063 making it 50 more potent than n2o as an anesthetic thus it can be used in concentrations with oxygen that have a lower risk of  hypoxia  unlike  nitrous oxide  n2o xenon is not a  greenhouse gas  and so it is also viewed as  environmentally friendly  because of the high cost of xenon however economic application will require a closed system so that the gas can be recycled with the gas being appropriately filtered for contaminants between uses
========
 gamma  emission from the  radioisotope  133xe of xenon can be used to image the heart lungs and brain for example by means of  single photon emission computed tomography   133xe has also been used to measure  blood flow
========
nuclei of only two of the stable  isotopes of xenon  129xe and 131xe have nonzero intrinsic  angular momenta   nuclear spins  when mixed with  alkali  vapor and  nitrogen  their nuclear spins can be aligned along the laser beam of  circularlypolarized  light that is tuned to an  absorption line  of the alkali atoms typically pure  rubidium  metal heated above 100  c  is used to produce the  alkali  vapor this alignment  spin polarization  of xenon  nuclei  can surpass 50 of its maximum possible value greatly exceeding the equilibrium value dictated by the  boltzmann distribution  typically 0001 of the maximum value at  room temperature  even in the strongest  magnets  such nonequilibrium alignment of spins is a temporary condition and is called  hyperpolarization  because the 129xe isotope has a  nuclear spin  value of 12 and therefore the electric  quadrupole moment  of 129xe nucleus must be zero 129xe nucleus does not experience any quadrupolar interactions during collisions with other atoms and thus its hyperpolarization can be maintained for long periods of time even after the laser beam has been turned off and the alcali vapor removed by condensation on a roomtemperature surface the time it takes for a collection of  spins  to return to their equilibrium boltzmann  polarization  is called the  tsub1sub relaxation time  for 129xe isotope it can range from several  seconds  for xenon atoms dissolved in  blood  to several hours in the  gas phase  and to several days in the deeplyfrozen solid xenon in contrast the  sup131supxe isotope  has a nuclear spin value of 32 does possess a nonzero  quadrupole moment  and has t1 relaxation times in the  millisecond  and  second  ranges the  hyperpolarization  process such as spinexchange optical pumping described above renders the 129xe isotope much more detectable via  magnetic resonance imaging  and has been used for studies of the lungs and other tissues  it can be used for example to trace the flow of gases within the lungs
========
in  nuclear energy  applications xenon is used in  bubble chambers  probes and in other areas where a high  molecular weight  and inert nature is desirable

liquid xenon is being used as a medium for detecting hypothetical  weakly interactive massive particles  or wimps when a wimp collides with a xenon nucleus it should theoretically strip an electron and create a primary  scintillation  by using xenon this burst of energy could then be readily distinguished from similar events caused by particles such as  cosmic rays  however the xenon experiment at the  gran sasso national laboratory  in italy has thus far failed to find any confirmed wimps even if no wimps are detected though the experiment will serve to constrain the properties of  dark matter  and some physics models the current detector at this facility is five times as sensitive as other instruments worldwide and the sensitivity will be increased by an  order of magnitude  in 2008
========
xenon is the preferred fuel for  ion propulsion  of  spacecraft  because of its low  ionization potential  per  atomic weight  the ability to store it as a liquid at near  room temperature  but at high pressure yet easily converts back into a gas to fuel the engine the inert nature of xenon makes it environmentally friendly and less corrosive to an  ion engine  than other fuels such as  mercury  or  caesium  xenon was first used for satellite ion engines during the 1970s it was later employed as a propellant for europes  smart1  spacecraft and for the three ion propulsion engines on nasas  dawn spacecraft
========
chemically the  perxenate  compounds are used as  oxidizing agents  in  analytical chemistry   xenon difluoride  is used as an etchant for  silicon  particularly in the production of  microelectromechanical systems  mems the anticancer drug  5fluorouracil  can be produced by reacting xenon difluoride with  uracil  xenon is also used in  protein crystallography  applied at pressures from 05 to 5nbsp mpa  5 to 50nbsp atm  to a protein crystal xenon atoms bind in predominantly  hydrophobic  cavities often creating a high quality isomorphous heavyatom derivative which can be used for solving the  phase problem

========
xenon gas can be safely kept in normal sealed  glass  or  metal  containers at  standard temperature and pressure  however it readily dissolves in most  plastics  and  rubber  and will gradually escape from a container sealed with such materials xenon is non toxic  although it does dissolve in blood and belongs to a select group of substances that penetrate the  bloodbrain barrier  causing mild  anaesthesia  when inhaled in very high concentrations see  anesthesia  subsection above many of  xenon compounds  are explosive and toxic due to their strong  oxidative  properties
========
at 169nbspms the  speed of sound  in xenon gas is slower than that in air due to the slower average speed of the heavy xenon atoms compared to nitrogen and oxygen molecules so xenon lowers the resonant frequencies of the  vocal tract  when inhaled  this produces a characteristic lowered voice pitch opposite the highpitched voice caused by inhalation of  helium  like helium xenon does not satisfy the bodys need for oxygen and is a simple  asphyxiant  consequently many universities no longer allow the voice stunt as a general chemistry demonstration  as xenon is expensive the gas  sulfur hexafluoride  which is similar to xenon in molecular weight 146 versus 131 is generally used in this stunt although it too is an asphyxiant
========
it is possible to safely breathe heavy gases such as xenon or sulfur hexafluoride when they include a 20 mixture of oxygen the lungs mix the gases very effectively and rapidly so that the heavy gases are purged along with the oxygen and do not accumulate at the bottom of the lungs there is however a danger associated with any heavy gas in large quantities it may sit invisibly in a container and if a person enters a container filled with an odorless colorless gas they may find themselves breathing it unknowingly  xenon is rarely used in large enough quantities for this to be a concern though the potential for danger exists any time a tank or container of xenon is kept in an unventilated space
