the purity of copper is expressed as 4n for 9999 pure or 7n for 9999999 pure the numeral gives the number of nines after the decimal point when expressed as a decimal eg 4n means 09999 or 9999
========
it is used extensively in products such as
========

========
 including but not limited to extreme  water  supply
========
  copper wire
  electromagnets
  printed circuit boards
  lead  free  solder  alloyed with  tin
  electrical machines  especially electromagnetic motors generators and transformers
 electrical  relays  electrical  busbars  and electrical  switches
  vacuum tubes   cathode ray tubes  and the  magnetrons  in  microwave ovens
  wave guides  for microwave radiation
  integrated circuits  increasingly replacing  aluminium  because of its superior electrical conductivity
 as a material in the manufacture of computer  heat sinks  as a result of its superior heat dissipation capacity to  aluminium

 copper has been used as waterproof  roofing  material since ancient times giving many old buildings their greenish roofs and domes initially  copper oxide  forms replaced by  cuprous and cupric sulfide  and finally by  copper carbonate  the final  carbonate   patina  is highly resistant to  corrosion
  statuary  the  statue of liberty  for example contains 179220 pounds 813  tonnes  of copper
 alloyed with  nickel  eg  cupronickel  and  monel  used as corrosive assistant materials in  shipbuilding
  watt s  steam engine
 copper  nails  were used in making  oast   cowls
========

========
 copper  plumbing  fittings and compression tubes
 doorknobs and other fixtures in houses
  roofing  guttering and rainspouts on buildings
 in  cookware  such as  frying pans
 most  flatware   knives   forks   spoons  contains some copper  nickel silver
  sterling silver  if it is to be used in dinnerware must contain a few percent copper
 copper water heating cylinders
========
 as a component of  coins  often as  cupronickel  alloy
 coins in the following countries all contain copper european union  euro  united states united kingdom  sterling  australia and new zealand
 ironically  us nickels  are 750 copper by weight and only 250  nickel
========
 as a  biostatic  surface in hospitals and to line parts of  ships  to protect against  barnacles  and  mussels  originally used pure but superseded by  muntz metal   bacteria  will not grow on a copper surface because it is biostatic copper  doorknobs  are used by  hospitals  to reduce the transfer of disease and  legionnaires disease  is suppressed by copper tubing in  airconditioning  systems
  copperii sulfate  is used as a  fungicide  and as algae control in domestic lakes and ponds it is used in gardening powders and sprays to kill  mildew
  copper62ptsm  a complex containing radioactive  copper62  is used as a  positron emission tomography  radiotracer for heart blood flow measurements
  copper64  can be used as a  positron emission tomography  radiotracer for  medical imaging   when complexed with a chelate it can be used to treat cancer through  radiation therapy
========
 compounds such as  fehlings solution  have applications in chemistry
 as a component in  ceramic glazes  and to color  glass
========
  musical instruments  especially  brass instruments  and  cymbals
  class d fire extinguisher  used in powder form to extinguish lithium fires by covering the burning metal and performing similar to a heat sink
 textile fibers to create  antimicrobial  protective fabrics

copper is essential in all plants and animals copper is carried mostly in the bloodstream on a  plasma protein  called  ceruloplasmin  when copper is first absorbed in the gut it is transported to the  liver  bound to  albumin  copper is found in a variety of  enzymes  including the copper centers of  cytochrome c oxidase  and the enzyme  superoxide dismutase  containing copper and zinc in addition to its enzymatic roles copper is used for biological electron transport the blue copper proteins that participate in electron transport include  azurin  and  plastocyanin  the name blue copper comes from their intense blue color arising from a ligandtometal charge transfer lmct absorption band around 600nbspnm
========
most  molluscs  and some  arthropods  such as the  horseshoe crab  use the coppercontaining pigment  hemocyanin  rather than  iron containing  hemoglobin  for oxygen transport so their blood is blue when oxygenated rather than red
========
it is believed that  zinc  and copper compete for absorption in the digestive tract so that a diet that is excessive in one of these minerals may result in a deficiency in the other the  rda  for copper in normal healthy adults is 09  mg day on the other hand professional research on the subject recommends 30  mg day because of its role in facilitating iron uptake  copper deficiency  can often produce  anemia like symptoms
========
all copper compounds unless otherwise known should be treated as if they were  toxic  thirty grams of copper sulfate is potentially lethal in humans the suggested safe level of copper in  drinking water  for humans varies depending on the source but tends to be pegged at 15 to 2nbspmgl the  dri  tolerable upper intake level for adults of dietary copper from all sources is 10 mgday in toxicity copper can inhibit the  enzyme   dihydrophil hydratase  an enzyme involved in  haemopoiesis
========
symptoms of copper  poisoning  are very similar to those produced by  arsenic  fatal cases are generally terminated by convulsions palsy and insensibility
========
in cases of suspected copper poisoning  ovalbumin  is to be administered in either of its forms which can be most readily obtained as milk or  whites of eggs  vinegar should not be given the inflammatory symptoms are to be treated on general principles and so are the nervous
