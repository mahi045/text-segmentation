naturallyoccurring zirconium is composed of four stable isotopes and one extremely longlived  radioisotope  96zr the second most stable radioisotope is  sup93supzr  which has a  halflife  of 153 million years  eighteen other radioisotopes have been observed most of these have halflives that are less than a day except for 95zr 6402 days 88zr 634 days and 89zr 7841 hours the primary decay mode is  electron capture  for isotopes lighter than 92zr and the primary mode for heavier isotopes is  beta decay  other isotopes of zirconium include 90zr 91zr and 94zr

mercury   also called quicksilver is a  chemical element  with the symbol hg  latinized     meaning watery or liquid silver and  atomic number  80 a heavy silvery  dblock   metal  mercury is one of five elements that are  liquid  at or near  room temperature  and pressure the others are the metals  caesium   francium  and  gallium  and the  nonmetal   bromine  of these only mercury and bromine are liquids at  standard conditions for temperature and pressure
========
mercury is used in  thermometers   barometers   manometers   sphygmomanometers   float valves  and other scientific apparatus though concerns about the elements toxicity have led to mercury thermometers and sphygmomanometers being largely phased out in clinical environments in favour of  alcohol filled digital or  thermistor based instruments it remains in use in a number of other ways in scientific and scientific research applications and in  dental amalgam  mercury is mostly obtained by reduction from the  mineral   cinnabar
========
mercury occurs in deposits throughout the world and it is harmless in an insoluble form such as mercuric sulfide but it is poisonous in soluble forms such as  mercuric chloride  or  methylmercury
========
mercury was known to the ancient  chinese  and  hindus  and was found in  egyptian  tombs that date from 1500 bc   in  china   india  and  tibet  mercury use was thought to prolong life heal fractures and maintain generally good health chinas first emperor  qin shi huang di  mdash said to have been buried in a tomb that contained rivers of flowing mercury representative of the rivers of china mdash qin was driven insane and killed by mercury pills failing liver poison brain death intended to give him eternal life   the  ancient greeks  used mercury in ointments and the  romans  used it in  cosmetics  by 500 bc mercury was used to make  amalgams  with other metals the indian word for  alchemy  is  rasavātam  which means the way of mercury
========
 alchemists  often thought of mercury as the  first matter  from which all metals were formed they believed that different  metals  could be produced by varying the quality and quantity of  sulfur  contained within the mercury  the purest of these was  gold  and mercury was required for the  transmutation  of base or impure metals into gold as was the goal of many alchemists
========
hg is the modern  chemical symbol  for mercury it comes from hydrargyrum a  latinized  form of the  greek  word υδραργυρος hydrargyros which is a compound word meaning water and silver mdash since it is liquid like water and yet has a silvery metallic sheen the element was named after the roman god  mercury  known for speed and mobility it is associated with the planet  mercury  the astrological symbol for the planet is also one of the alchemical symbols for the metal mercury is the only metal for which the alchemical planetary name became the common name
========

mercury is an extremely rare element in the earths crust having an average crustal abundance by mass of only 008 parts per million however because it does not blend  geochemically  with those elements that constitute the majority of the crustal mass mercury ores can be extraordinarily concentrated considering the elements abundance in ordinary rock the richest mercury ores contain up to 25 mercury by mass and even the leanest concentrated deposits are at least 01 mercury 12000 times average crustal abundance
========
it is found either as a native metal rare or in  cinnabar   corderoite   livingstonite  and other  minerals  with cinnabar hg s  being the most common ore mercury ores usually occur in very young orogenic belts where rock of high density are forced to the crust of the earth often in hot springs or other  volcanic  regions
========
over 100000 tons of mercury were mined from the region of  huancavelica   peru  over the course of three centuries following the discovery of deposits there in 1563 mercury from huancavelica was crucial in the production of silver in colonial spanish america many former ores in  italy   slovenia  the  united states  and  mexico  which once produced a large proportion of the worlds supply have now been completely mined out the metal is extracted by heating cinnabar in a current of air and condensing the vapor the equation for this extraction is
hgs  o2  hg  so2
========
in 2005 china was the top producer of mercury with almost twothirds global share followed by  kyrgyzstan  reports the  british geological survey    several other countries are believed to have unrecorded production of mercury from copper  electrowinning  processes and by recovery from effluents
========
due to minimal surface disruption mercury mines lend themselves to constructive reuse for example in 1976  santa clara county california  purchased the  historic almaden quicksilver mine  and proceeded to create a county park on the site after conducting extensive safety and environmental analysis of the property
