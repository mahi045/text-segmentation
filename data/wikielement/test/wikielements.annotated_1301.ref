a significant portion of the toxicity of copper comes from its ability to accept and donate single electrons as it changes oxidation state this catalyzes the production of very reactive radical ions such as  hydroxyl radical  in a manner similar to  fenton chemistry  this catalytic activity of copper is used by the enzymes that it is associated with and is thus only toxic when unsequestered and unmediated this increase in unmediated reactive radicals is generally termed  oxidative stress  and is an active area of research in a variety of diseases where copper may play an important but more subtle role than in acute toxicity
