the most important salts are
  mercuryi chloride  aka  calomel  is sometimes still used in  medicine  and acoustooptical filters
  mercuryii chloride  which is very  corrosive   sublimates  and is a violent poison
  mercury fulminate  a  detonator  widely used in  explosives
  mercuryii oxide  the main  oxide  of mercury
  mercuryii sulfide  aka  cinnabar  mercuric ore still used in oriental medicine or  vermilion  which is a highgrade  paint pigment
  mercuryii selenide  a  semiconductor
  mercuryii telluride  a  semiconductor  and
  mercury cadmium telluride  and  mercury zinc telluride   infrared detector  materials

laboratory tests have found that an electrical discharge causes the  noble gases  to combine with mercury vapor these compounds are held together with  van der waals forces  and result in hgne hgar hgkr and hgxe see  exciplex  organic mercury  compounds  are also important  methylmercury  is a dangerous compound that is widely found as a  pollutant  in water bodies and streams

mercury and most of its compounds are extremely toxic and are generally handled with care in cases of spills involving mercury such as from certain  thermometers  or  fluorescent light bulbs  specific cleaning procedures are used to avoid toxic exposure  it can be inhaled and absorbed through the skin and mucous membranes so containers of mercury are securely sealed to avoid spills and evaporation heating of mercury or compounds of mercury that may decompose when heated should always be carried out with adequate ventilation in order to avoid exposure to mercury vapor the most toxic forms of mercury are its  organic compounds  such as  dimethylmercury  and  methylmercury
========
due to the health effects of mercury exposure industrial and commercial uses are regulated in many countries the  world health organization   osha  and  niosh  all treat mercury as an occupational hazard and have established specific occupational exposure limits environmental releases and disposal of mercury are regulated in the us primarily by the  united states environmental protection agency
========
 case control studies  have shown effects such as tremors impaired cognitive skills and sleep disturbance in workers with chronic exposure to mercury vapour even at low concentrations in the range 0742 Î¼gm3
========
a study has shown that acute exposure 48 hours to calculated elemental mercury levels of 11 to 44 mgm3 resulted in chest pain  dyspnea  cough  hemoptysis  impairment of pulmonary function and evidence of interstitial  pneumonitis
========
acute exposure to mercury vapor has been shown to result in profound central nervous system effects including psychotic reactions characterized by delirium hallucinations and suicidal tendency occupational exposure has resulted in broadranging functional disturbance including  erethism  irritability excitability excessive shyness and insomnia with continuing exposure a fine tremor develops and may escalate to violent muscular spasms tremor initially involves the hands and later spreads to the eyelids lips and tongue longterm lowlevel exposure has been associated with more subtle symptoms of erethism including fatigue irritability loss of memory vivid dreams and depression
========
research on the treatment of mercury poisoning is limited currently available drugs for acute mercurial poisoning include chelators nacetyldlpenicillamine nap  british antilewisite  bal  23dimercapto1propanesulfonic acid  dmps and  dimercaptosuccinic acid  dmsa in one small study including 11 construction workers exposed to elemental mercury patients were treated with dmsa and nap chelation therapy with both drugs resulted in the mobilization of a small fraction of the total estimated body mercury dmsa was able to increase the excretion of mercury to a greater extent than nap

 fish  and  shellfish  have a natural tendency to concentrate mercury in their bodies often in the form of  methylmercury  a highly toxic organic compound of mercury species of fish that are high on the  food chain  such as  shark   swordfish   king mackerel   albacore tuna  and  tilefish  contain higher concentrations of mercury than others this is because mercury is stored in the muscle tissues of fish and when a predatory fish eats another fish it assumes the entire body burden of mercury in the consumed fish since fish are less efficient at depurating than accumulating methylmercury fishtissue concentrations increase over time thus species that are high on the  food chain  amass body burdens of mercury that can be ten times higher or more than the species they consume this process is called  biomagnification  the first occurrence of widespread  mercury poisoning  in humans occurred this way in  minamata   japan  now called  minamata disease
========
the complexities associated with mercury fate and transport are relatively succinctly described by usepa in their 1997 mercury study report to congress because methylmercury and high levels of elemental mercury can be particularly toxic to unborn or young children organizations such as the  us epa  and fda recommend that women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant within the next one or two years as well as young children avoid eating more than 6 ounces one average meal of fish per week in the united states the fda has an action level for methyl mercury in commercial marine and freshwater fish that is 10 parts per million ppm and in canada the limit for the total of mercury content is 05 ppm
========
species with characteristically low levels of mercury include  shrimp   tilapia   salmon   pollock  and  catfish  fda march 2004 the fda characterizes shrimp catfish pollock salmon and canned light tuna as lowmercury seafood although recent tests have indicated that up to 6 percent of canned light tuna may contain high levels

mercury readily combines with  aluminium  to form a  mercuryaluminum amalgam  when the two pure metals come into contact however when the amalgam is exposed to air the aluminium oxidizes leaving behind mercury the oxide flakes away exposing more mercury amalgam which repeats the process this process continues until the supply of amalgam is exhausted and since it releases mercury a small amount of mercury can eat through a large amount of aluminium over time by progressively forming amalgam and relinquishing the aluminium as oxide
========
aluminium in air is ordinarily protected by a moleculethin layer of its own oxide which is not porous to oxygen mercury coming into contact with this oxide does no harm however if any elemental aluminium is exposed even by a recent scratch the mercury may combine with it starting the process described above and potentially damaging a large part of the aluminium before it finally ends
========
for this reason restrictions are placed on the use and handling of mercury in proximity with aluminium in particular mercury is not allowed aboard aircraft under most circumstances because of the risk of it forming amalgam with exposed aluminium parts in the aircraft
========
in the  european union  directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment see  rohs  bans mercury from certain electrical and electronic products and limits the amount of mercury in other products to less than 1000  ppm
========
besides in the european union there are restriction for mercury concentration in packaging the limit is 100 ppm for sum of mercury  lead   hexavalent chromium  and  cadmium  and batteries the limit is 5 ppm
========
in july 2007 european union also banned mercury in nonelectrical measuring devices such as thermometers and barometers  the ban applies to new devices only and contains exemptions for the healthcare sector and a twoyear grace period for manufacurers of barometers
