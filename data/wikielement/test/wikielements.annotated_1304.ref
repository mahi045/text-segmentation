naturally occurring praseodymium is composed of one stable  isotope  141pr thirtyeight  radioisotopes  have been characterized with the most stable being 143pr with a  halflife  of 1357 days and 142pr with a halflife of 1912 hours all of the remaining  radioactive  isotopes have halflives that are less than 5985 hours and the majority of these have halflives that are less than 33 seconds this element also has six  meta states  with the most stable being 138mpr t 212 hours 142mpr t 146 minutes and 134mpr t 11 minutes
========
the isotopes of praseodymium range in  atomic weight  from 120955  u  121pr to 158955 u 159pr the primary  decay mode  before the stable isotope 141pr is  electron capture  and the primary mode after is  beta minus decay  the primary  decay products  before 141pr are element 58  cerium  isotopes and the primary products after are element 60  neodymium  isotopes
========
like all rare earths praseodymium is of low to moderate toxicity praseodymium has no known biological role

plutonium    is a  radioactive   metallic   and  toxic   chemical element  it has the symbol pu and the  atomic number  94 it is a  fissile  element used in most modern  nuclear weapons  the most significant  isotope  of plutonium is 239pu with a  halflife  of 24100 years it can be made from natural  uranium  the most stable isotope is 244pu with a halflife of about 80 million years long enough to be found in extremely small quantities in nature making 244pu the  nucleon richest  atom that naturally occurs in the  earths crust  albeit in small traces
========
plutonium has been called the most complex metal and a physicists dream but an engineers nightmare for its peculiar physical and chemical properties it has six  allotropes  normally and a seventh under pressure each of which have very similar energy levels but with significantly varying densities making it very sensitive to changes in temperature pressure or chemistry and allowing for dramatic volume changes following phase transitions in nuclear applications it is usually  alloyed  with a small amount of  gallium  which stabilizes it in the deltaphase plutonium is silvery in pure form but has a yellow tarnish when  oxidized  it possesses a lowsymmetry structure causing it to become progressively more brittle over time because it selfirradiates it ages both from the outsidein and the insideout
however selfirradiation can also lead to  annealing  which counteracts some of the aging effects  in general the precise aging properties of plutonium are very complex and poorly understood greatly complicating efforts to predict future reliability of weapons components
========
the heat given off by  alpha particle emission  makes plutonium warm to the touch in reasonable quantities it displays five ionic  oxidation states  in aqueous solution
puiii as pu3 blue lavender
puiv as pu4 yellow brown
puv as puo2 thought to be pink this ion is unstable in solution and will disproportionate into pu4 and puo22 the pu4 will then oxidize the remaining puo2 to puo22 being reduced in turn to pu3 thus aqueous solutions of plutonium tend over time towards a mixture of pu3 and puo22
puvi as puo22 pink orange
puvii as puo52 dark red the heptavalent ion is rare and prepared only under extreme oxidizing conditions
the actual color shown by pu solutions depends on both the oxidation state and the nature of the acid anion which influences the degree of complexing of the pu species by the acid anion
========
the isotope 239pu is a key  fissile  component in  nuclear weapons  due to its ease of fissioning and availability the  critical mass  for an  unreflected  sphere of plutonium is 16 kg but through the use of a  neutronreflecting  tamper the pit of plutonium in a fission bomb is reduced to 10 kg which is a sphere with a diameter of 10 cm the  manhattan project   fat man  type plutonium bombs using explosive compression of pu to significantly higher densities than normal were able to function with plutonium cores of only 62 kg complete detonation may be achieved through the use of an additional neutron source often from a small amount of fusion fuel  the  fat man  bomb had an explosive yield of 21 kilotons see also  nuclear weapon design
========
the isotope  plutonium238  238pu has a halflife of 88 years and emits a large amount of  thermal energy  as it decays being an  alpha  emitter it combines high energy radiation with low penetration thereby requiring minimal shielding these characteristics make it well suited for electrical power generation for devices which must function without direct maintenance for timescales approximating a human lifetime it is therefore used in  radioisotope thermoelectric generators  such as those powering the  cassini  and  new horizons pluto  space probes earlier versions of the same technology powered the  alsep  and  easep  systems including  seismic  experiments on the  apollo   moon  missions
========
238pu has been used successfully to power artificial heart  pacemakers  to reduce the risk of repeated surgery it has been largely replaced by  lithium based  primary cells  but as of 2003 there were somewhere between 50 and 100 plutoniumpowered pacemakers still implanted and functioning in living patients

the production of plutonium and  neptunium  by bombarding  uranium238  with neutrons was predicted in 1940 by two teams working independently  edwin m mcmillan  and  philip abelson  at  berkeley radiation laboratory  at the  university of california berkeley  and by  egon bretscher  and  norman feather  at the  cavendish laboratory  of the  university of cambridge  for the  tube alloys project  coincidentally both teams proposed the same names to follow on from uranium following the sequence of the outer planets
========
plutonium was first produced and isolated on  december 14   1940  by dr  glenn t seaborg   edwin m mcmillan   j w kennedy  and  a c wahl  by  deuteron  bombardment of uranium in the 60inch cyclotron at berkeley the discovery was kept secret due to the  war   it was named after  pluto  having been discovered directly after  neptunium  which itself was one higher on the periodic table than  uranium  by analogy to solar system planet order as pluto was considered to be a planet at the time though technically it should have been plutium seaborg said that he did not think it sounded as good as plutonium seaborg chose the letters pu as a joke which passed without notice into the periodic table originally seaborg and others thought about naming the element ultinium or extremium because they believed at the time that they had found the last possible  element  on the  periodic table
========
chemists at the  university of chicago  began to study the newly manufactured radioactive element the  george herbert jones laboratory  at the university was the site where on 18 august 1942 a trace quantity of this new element was isolated and measured for the first time  this procedure enabled chemists to determine the new elements atomic weight room 405 of the building was named a  national historic landmark  in may 1967
