ununhexium    is the temporary name of a  synthetic   superheavy element  in the  periodic table  that has the temporary symbol uuh and has the atomic number 116 some research has referred to it as  eka  polonium
========
in december  2000  the  joint institute for nuclear research   dubna   russia  published results that described the discovery in  2000  of decay of the isotope 292uuh which was produced in the reaction of 248 cm  with 48 ca   curium  and  calcium  elements 96 and 20 respectively it has a halflife of about 18 milliseconds 0018 seconds and decayed into 288 uuq   ununquadium  element 114 on  may 11  2001  the institute reported synthesizing a second atom and that the properties confirmed a region of enhanced stability see  island of stability
========
in  2004  in the  joint institute for nuclear research  the synthesis of this element was confirmed by another method the chemical identifying on final products of decay of element
========
ununhexium is a temporary  iupac   systematic element name
========
in october 2006 it was announced that on three occasions californium249 atoms had been bombarded with  calcium 48 ions to produce  ununoctium  element 118 which decayed to ununhexium within a millisecond if confirmed the synthesis of element 116 will have been proven definitively
========
the reaction that created ununhexium is

========
this decayed 47 milliseconds later as follows to a previously identified isotope of element 114 uuq

========
in  1999  researchers at  lawrence berkeley national laboratory  announced the discovery of elements 116 and  118  ununhexium and  ununoctium  in a paper published in physical review letters the following year they published a  retraction  after other researchers were unable to duplicate the results in june  2002  the director of the lab announced that the original claim of the discovery of these two elements had been based on data fabricated by the principal author  victor ninov
