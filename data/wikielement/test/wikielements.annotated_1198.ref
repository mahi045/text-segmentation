albert r behnke jr began exploring the causes of drunkenness in deepsea divers in 1939 he tested the effects of varying the breathing mixtures on his subjects and discovered that this caused the divers to perceive a change in depth from his results he deduced that xenon gas could serve as an  anesthetic   although lazharev in russia apparently studied xenon anesthesia in 1941 the first published report confirming xenon anesthesia was in 1946 by j h lawrence who experimented on mice  xenon was first used as a surgical anesthetic in 1951 by stuart c cullen who successfully operated on two patients

in 1960 the physicist  john h reynolds  discovered that certain  meteorites  contained an isotopic anomaly in the form of an overabundance of xenon129 he inferred that this was a  decay product  of radioactive  iodine 129 as the halflife of 129i is
16 million years this demonstrated that the meteorites were formed during the early history of the  solar system  as the 129i isotope was likely generated before the solar system was formed

xenon and the other noble gases were for a long time considered to be completely chemically inert and not able to form  compounds   however while teaching at the  university of british columbia   neil bartlett  discovered that the gas  platinum hexafluoride  ptf6 was a powerful  oxidizing  agent that could oxidize oxygen o2 to form  dioxygenyl hexafluoroplatinate  o2 ptf6 minus  since o2 and xenon have almost the same first  ionization potential  bartlett realized that platinum hexafluoride might also be able to oxidize xenon  on  march 23   1962  he mixed the two gases and produced the first known compound of a noble gas  xenon hexafluoroplatinate   bartlett thought its composition to be xe ptf6 minus although later work has revealed that it was probably a mixture of various xenoncontaining salts since then many other xenon compounds have been discovered  and some compounds of the noble gases  argon   krypton  and  radon  have been identified including  argon fluorohydride  harf  krypton difluoride  krf2  and  radon fluoride

xenon is a  trace gas  in  earths atmosphere  occurring at 00870001nbsp parts per million  μll  it is also found in gases emitted from some  mineral springs  some radioactive species of xenon for example 133xe and 135xe are produced by  neutron  irradiation of fissionable material within  nuclear reactors
========
xenon is obtained commercially as a byproduct of the separation of air into  oxygen  and  nitrogen   after this separation generally performed by  fractional distillation  in a doublecolumn plant the  liquid oxygen  produced will contain small quantities of krypton and xenon  by additional fractional distillation steps the liquid oxygen may be enriched to contain 01ndash02 of a kryptonxenon mixture which is extracted either via adsorption onto  silica gel  or by distillation  finally the kryptonxenon mixture may be separated into  krypton  and xenon via distillation extraction of a liter of xenon from the atmosphere requires 220  watthours
of energy  worldwide production of xenon in 1998 was estimated at 50007000nbspm3 due to its low abundance xenon is much more expensive than the lighter noble gasesapproximate prices for the purchase of small quantities in europe in 1999 were 10nbsp  l for xenon 1nbspl for krypton and 020nbspl for neon
========
xenon is relatively rare in the  sun s atmosphere on  earth  and in the  asteroids  and  comets  the  atmosphere of mars  shows a similar xenon abundance to that of earth
008nbspparts per million however mars shows a higher proportion of 129xe than the earth or the sun as this isotope is generated by radioactive decay the result may indicate that mars lost most of its primordial atmosphere possibly within the first 100 million years after the planet was formed by contrast the planet  jupiter  has an unusually high abundance of xenon in its atmosphere about 26 times as much as the sun this high abundance remains unexplained but may have been caused by an early and rapid buildup of  planetesimals mdashsmall subplanetary bodiesmdashbefore the  presolar disk  began to heat up otherwise xenon would not have been trapped in the planetesimal ices within the  solar system  the  nucleon  fraction for all isotopes of xenon is 156 times 108 or one part in 64nbspmillion of the total mass the problem of the low terrestrial xenon may potentially be explained by  covalent bonding  of xenon to oxygen within  quartz  hence reducing the outgassing of xenon into the atmosphere
========
unlike the lower mass noble gases the normal  stellar nucleosynthesis  process inside a star does not form xenon elements more massive than  iron56  have a net energy cost to produce through fusion so there is no energy gain for a star to create xenon instead many isotopes of xenon are formed during  supernova  explosions
========

an atom of xenon is defined as having a nucleus with 54  protons  at  standard temperature and pressure  pure xenon gas has a density of 5761nbspkgm3 about 45 times the surface density of the earths atmosphere 1217nbspkgm3 as a liquid xenon has a density of up to 3100nbspgml with the density maximum occurring at the triple point under the same conditions the density of solid xenon 3640nbspgcm3 is larger than the average density of  granite  275nbspgcm3
========
xenon is a member of the zero valence  elements that are called  noble  or  inert   gases  it is inert to most common chemical reactions such as combustion for example because the outer  valence shell  is completely filled with eight electrons this produces a stable minimum energy configuration in which the outer electrons are tightly bound however xenon can be  oxidized  by powerful oxidizing agents and many xenon compounds have been synthesized
========
in a  gasfilled tube  xenon emits a  blue  or  lavenderish  glow when the gas is excited by  electrical discharge  xenon emits a band of  emission lines  that span the visual spectrum
but the most intense lines occur in the region of blue light which produces the coloration
========

naturally occurring xenon is made of nine  stable   isotopes  the isotopes 124xe 134xe and 136xe are predicted to undergo  double beta decay  but this has never been observed so they are considered to be stable
besides these stable forms there are over 40 unstable isotopes that have been studied  129xe is produced by  beta decay  of 129 i  which has a  halflife  of 16nbspmillion years while 131mxe 133xe 133mxe and 135xe are some of the  fission  products of both 235 u  and 239 pu  and therefore used as indicators of nuclear explosions the various isotopes of xenon are produced from  supernova  explosions and the radioactive decay of elements such as  iodine   uranium  and  plutonium
========
the artificial isotope  sup135supxe  is of considerable significance in the operation of  nuclear fission reactors  135xe has a huge  cross section  for  thermal neutrons  26times106nbsp barns  so it acts as a  neutron absorber  or  poison  that can slow or stop the chain reaction after a period of operation this was discovered in the earliest nuclear reactors built by the american  manhattan project  for  plutonium  production fortunately the designers had made provisions in the design to increase the reactors reactivity the number of neutrons per fission that go on to fission other atoms of  nuclear fuel
========
under adverse conditions relatively high concentrations of radioactive xenon isotopes may be found emanating from nuclear reactors due to the release of fission products from cracked fuel rods or fissioning of uranium in  cooling water
========
because xenon is a tracer for two parent isotopes xenon isotope ratios in  meteorites  are a powerful tool for studying the  formation of the solar system  the iodinexenon method of  dating  gives the time elapsed between  nucleosynthesis  and the condensation of a solid object from the  solar nebula  xenon isotopic ratios such as 129xe130xe and 136xe130xe are also a powerful tool for understanding terrestrial differentiation and early outgassing excess 129xe found in  carbon dioxide  well gases from  new mexico  was believed to be from the decay of  mantle derived gases soon after earths formation
