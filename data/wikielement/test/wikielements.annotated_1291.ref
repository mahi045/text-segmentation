manufacturing ununquadium298 would be very difficult because nuclei summing to 114 protons and 184 neutrons are not available in weighable quantities
========
however it may be possible to generate ununquadium298 if nuclear transfer reactions can be achieved   one of these reactions may be

ununtrium    or  eka  thallium  is the temporary name of a  synthetic element  in the  periodic table  that has the temporary symbol uut and has the  atomic number  113  it comes from the alpha decay release of a  helium  nucleus of  ununpentium  following periodic trends it is expected to be a soft silvery highly reactive metal rather like  sodium
========
on  february 1   2004  the discovery of ununtrium and  ununpentium  were reported by a team composed of  russian  scientists at  dubna   joint institute for nuclear research  and  american  scientists at the  lawrence livermore national laboratory
========
on  september 28  2004 a team of  japanese  scientists at  riken  declared that they succeeded in synthesizing the element
========
in may  2006  at the  joint institute for nuclear research  the synthesis of this element was confirmed by another method the chemical identifying on final products of decay of element
