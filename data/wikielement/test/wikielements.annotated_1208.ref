yttrium    is a  chemical element  that has the symbol y and  atomic number  39 a silvery metallic  transition metal  yttrium is common in  rareearth minerals  and two of its compounds are used to make the red color  phosphors  in  cathode ray tube  displays such as those used for  televisions
========
yttrium is a silvermetallic lustrous  rare earth  metal that is relatively stable in air strongly resembles scandium in appearance and chemically resembles the  lanthanides  and can appear to gain a slight pink lustre on exposure to light shavings or  turnings  of the metal can ignite in air when they exceed 400  c  when  yttrium is finely divided it is very unstable in air the metal has a low  neutron crosssection  for nuclear capture the common  oxidation state  of yttrium is 3
========
 yttriumiii oxide  is the most important yttrium compound and is widely used to make y v  o 4 eu  and y2o3 eu   phosphors  that give the red color in  color television  picture tubes other uses
========
yttrium oxide is also used to make  yttrium iron garnets  which are very effective  microwave   filters
yttrium iron  aluminium  and  gadolinium  garnets  eg y3fe5o12 and y3al5o12 have interesting  magnetic  properties  yttrium iron garnet  is very efficient as an acoustic energy transmitter and transducer  yttrium aluminium garnet  has a hardness of 85 and is also used as a  gemstone  simulated  diamond
small amounts of the element 01 to 02 have been used to reduce grain size of  chromium   molybdenum   titanium  and  zirconium  it is also used to increase the  strength  of aluminium and  magnesium  alloys
used as a  catalyst  for  ethylene   polymerization
yttrium aluminium garnet  yttrium lithium fluoride  and  yttrium vanadate  are used in combination with  dopants  such as  neodymium  or  erbium  in  infrared   lasers
it is used on the electrodes of some highperformance  spark plugs
this metal can be used to  deoxidize   vanadium  and other  nonferrous metals
yttrium is also used in the manufacture of  gas mantles  for  propane   lanterns  as a replacement for  thorium  which is slightly  radioactive
 cerium  doped   yttrium aluminium garnet  yagce crystals are used as  phosphors  to make white  leds
yttrium90 microspheres have shown promise as a treatment for unresectable  hepatocellular carcinoma
yttrium was used as a secret element in a  ybco   superconductor  developed at the  university of houston   ybacuo  this superconductor operated above 90k notable because this is above  liquid nitrogen s boiling point 771k y12ba08cuo4 the matter created was a multicrystal multiphase mineral which was black and green
yttrium has been studied for possible use as a nodulizer in the making of  nodular cast iron  which has increased  ductility  the  graphite  forms compact nodules instead of flakes to form nodular cast iron potentially yttrium can be used in  ceramic  and  glass  formulas since yttrium oxide has a high  melting point  and imparts  shock  resistance and low  thermal expansion  characteristics to glass
 yttrium oxide is used to stabilize the  cubic form of zirconia  for use in jewelry etc
 yttria  yttriumiii oxide  is used as a  sintering  additive in the production of porous  silicon nitride
 yttrium90 is used in  zevalin  which is a  radioimmunotherapy  directed against some types of  nonhodgkins lymphoma
========
yttrium named for  ytterby  a swedish village near  vaxholm  was discovered by finnish chemist physicist and mineralogist  johan gadolin  in  1794  and isolated by  friedrich wöhler  in  1828  as an impure extract of  yttria  through the reduction of yttrium anhydrous  chloride   y cl 3 with  potassium  yttria y2o3 is the oxide of yttrium and was discovered by johan gadolin in  1794  in a  gadolinite  mineral from ytterby
========
in  1843  the swedish chemist  carl mosander  was able to show that yttria could be divided into the oxides or earths of three different elements yttria was the name which was retained for the most  basic  one which also happened to comprise the bulk of the crude mixture typically about twothirds and the others were renamed  erbia  and  terbia   later in the 19th century both of these would also be shown to be complex although the names would be retained for the most characteristic component of each
========
a quarry is located near the village of  ytterby  that yielded many unusual minerals that contained  rare earths  and other elements the elements  erbium   terbium   ytterbium  and yttrium have all been named after this same small village
========
this  element is found in almost all  rareearth minerals  and in  uranium   ores  but is never found in nature as a free element yttrium is commercially recovered from  monazite  sand 3 content     ce   la  etc posub4sub     and from  bastnäsite  02 content     ce la etc co 3 f     it is commercially produced by reducing yttrium  fluoride  with  calcium  metal but it can also be produced using other techniques it is difficult to separate from other rare earths and when extracted is a dark gray powder
the original rare earths ceria 1803 and yttria 1794 reflect the great geochemical divide that occurs between the light and heavy lanthanides due to lanthanide contraction the lighter lanthanides with a larger radius partition into minerals in sites with a higher coordination number eg monazite whereas the smaller heavy lanthanides prefer a slightly lower coordination number as in xenotime  the lighter lanthanides are also more relatively abundant in the earths outer crust than the heavies relative to the abundance in chondritic meteorites due to size fractionation yttrium falls into the middle of the heavy group in size and thus inevitably occurs with these in minerals where it comprises about twothirds of the mixed oxides by weight this composition is typical of gadolinite xenotime and certain ion adsorption clays currently mined in the south of china
========
 lunar rock  samples from the  apollo program  have a relatively high yttrium content

natural yttrium is composed of only one  isotope  y89 the most stable  radioisotopes  are y88 which has a  half life  of 10665 days and y91 with a half life of 5851 days all the other isotopes have half lives of less than a day except y87 which has a half life of 798 hours the dominant  decay mode  below the stable y89 is  electron capture  and the dominant mode after it is  beta emission  twenty six unstable isotopes have been characterized
========
y90 exists in equilibrium with its parent isotope  strontium 90 which is a product of  nuclear explosions
========
compounds that contain this element are rarely encountered by most people but should be considered to be highly toxic even though many compounds pose little risk   yttrium salts may be  carcinogenic    this element is not normally found in human tissue and plays no known biological role
