ununbium    or  eka  mercury  is a temporary  iupac   systematic element name  for a  chemical element  in the  periodic table  that has the  temporary  symbol uub and the  atomic number  112 element 112 is one of the  superheavy elements  following periodic trends one might expect a liquid metal more volatile than  mercury   however some experimental work so far indicates a gas and theoretical considerations also point to properties more similar to a  noble gas  than to mercury
========
ununbium was  first created  on  february 9   1996  at the  gesellschaft f√ºr schwerionenforschung  gsi in  darmstadt   germany  this element was created by fusing a  zinc 70 nucleus with a  lead 208 nucleus by accelerating zinc nuclei into a lead target in a heavy  ion accelerator  the two ununbium nuclei so produced had a mass number of 277
========
the element was synthesized in  2000  and  2004  in the  joint institute for nuclear research   russia
========
in may  2006  in the  jinr  synthesis of this element was confirmed by another method the isotope 282uub was identified as a final product of this series of  alpha decays
========

========
it was found that the final nucleus undergoes  spontaneous fission  spontaneous fission products are much smaller and irregular

ununquadium    or  eka  lead  is the temporary name of a  radioactive   chemical element  in the  periodic table  that has the temporary symbol uuq and has the  atomic number  114
========
the discovery of ununquadium in december  1998  was reported in january  1999  by scientists at  dubna   joint institute for nuclear research  in  russia  the same team produced another isotope of uuq three months later and confirmed the synthesis in  2004  and  2006
========
in  2004  in the  joint institute for nuclear research  the synthesis of this element was confirmed by another method the chemical identifying on final products of decay of element
========
ununquadium is a temporary  iupac   systematic element name  some have termed it ekalead as its properties are conjectured to be similar to those of  lead  it is expected to be a soft dense metal that tarnishes in air with a melting point around 200 degrees celsius
========
ununquadium can be synthesized by bombarding  plutonium 242 and 244 targets with  calcium48  heavy ion beams such as in
