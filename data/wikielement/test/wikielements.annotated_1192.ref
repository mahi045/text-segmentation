vanadium    is a  chemical element  that has the symbol v and  atomic number  23 a soft and ductile element vanadium naturally occurs in certain  minerals  and is used mainly to produce certain  alloys  it is one of the 26 elements found in most living organisms
========
vanadium is a soft and ductile silvergrey metal it has good resistance to  corrosion  by  alkalis   sulfuric  and  hydrochloric acid  it  oxidizes  readily at about 933  k  660 c vanadium has good structural strength and a low fission neutron cross section making it useful in nuclear applications although a metal it shares with   chromium  and  manganese  the property of having valency oxides with  acid  properties
========
common  oxidation states  of vanadium include 2 3 4 and 5 a popular experiment with ammonium vanadate nh4vo3 reducing the compound with  zinc  metal can demonstrate colorimetrically all four of these vanadium oxidation states a 1 oxidation state is rarely seen
========
approximately 80 of vanadium produced is used as  ferrovanadium  or as a  steel  additive other uses
 in such  alloys  as
 specialty  stainless steel  eg for use in  surgical instruments  and  tools
  rust  resistant and high speed tool steels
 mixed with  aluminium  in  titanium  alloys used in  jet engines  and highspeed airframes
 vanadium steel alloys are used in  axles   crankshafts  gears and other critical components
 it is an important  carbide  stabilizer in making steels
 because of its low  fission   neutron  cross section vanadium has nuclear applications
 vanadium foil is used in  cladding  titanium to steel
  vanadiumgallium  tape is used in  superconducting  magnets 175000  gauss
  vanadium pentoxide  v2o5 is used as a  catalyst  in manufacturing  sulfuric acid  via the  contact process  and  maleic anhydride  it is also used in making  ceramics
 glass coated with  vanadium dioxide  vo2 can block  infrared radiation  and not visible light at a specific temperature
 electrical  fuel cells  and storage batteries such as  vanadium redox batteries
 added to  corundum  to make simulated  alexandrite  jewelry
  vanadate   electrochemical conversion coatings  for protecting steel against rust and corrosion
 used to make  lacrosse shafts

 possibly used to make  wootz steel  and  damascus steel

vanadium was originally  discovered  by  andrés manuel del río  a spanishborn mexican mineralogist in  mexico city  in  1801  he called it brown lead now named  vanadinite  through experimentation its colors reminded him of  chromium  so he named the element panchromium he later renamed this compound erythronium since most of the salts turned red when heated the french chemist  hippolyte victor colletdescotils  incorrectly declared that del ríos new element was only impure  chromium  del río thought himself to be mistaken and accepted the statement of the french chemist that was also backed by del ríos friend baron  alexander von humboldt
========
in  1831   sefström  of  sweden  rediscovered vanadium in a new oxide he found while working with some  iron  ores and later that same year  friedrich wöhler  confirmed del ríos earlier work later
 george william featherstonhaugh  one of the first us geologists suggested that the element should be named rionium after del río but this never happened
========
metallic vanadium was isolated by  henry enfield roscoe  in  1867  who reduced  vanadiumiii chloride  vcl3 with  hydrogen  the name vanadium comes from  vanadis  a goddess in  scandinavian mythology  because the element has beautiful multicolored  chemical compounds
========
in  biology  a vanadium atom is an essential component of some  enzymes  particularly the vanadium  nitrogenase  used by some  nitrogenfixing  microorganisms vanadium is essential to  ascidians  or  sea squirts  in  vanadium chromagen proteins  the concentration of vanadium in their blood is more than 100 times higher than the concentration of vanadium in the seawater around them  rats  and  chickens  are also known to require vanadium in very small amounts and deficiencies result in reduced growth and impaired  reproduction
========
ten percent of the  blood cell  pigment of the  sea cucumber  is vanadium just as the  horseshoe crab  has blue blood rather than  red blood  colored by iron in  hemoglobin  because of  copper  in the  hemocyanin  pigment the blood of the sea cucumber is yellow because of the vanadium in the  vanabin  pigment nonetheless there is no evidence that vanabins carry oxygen in contrast to hemoglobin and hemocyanin

a form of  vanadium  vanadyl sulfate seems to improve glucose control in people with type 2 diabetes
========
most continental waters show a vanadium concentration of less than 3  ppb  however the groundwater of  mt fuji  contains a very high concentration of vanadiumup to 150 ppb this vanadium is solubilized from the basalt by the groundwater the vanadium content in mt fuji becomes higher at places nearer the summit and deeper in the ground recently this highvanadium water of mt fuji has been sold by many companies as an agent to cope with diabetes however there is no concrete evidence for its efficacy the rainbow trout living in the mt fuji water showed much higher accumulation of vanadium in kidneys and bone
========
vanadium is never found unbound in nature but it does occur in about 65 different  minerals  among which are  patronite  vs4  vanadinite  pb5vo43cl and  carnotite  k2uo22vo423h2o vanadium is also present in  bauxite  and in  carbon  containing deposits such as  crude oil   coal   oil shale  and  tar  sands vanadium has also been detected spectroscopically in light from the  sun  and some other  stars
========
much of the vanadium metal being produced is now made by  calcium  reduction of  vsub2subosub5sub  in a pressure vessel vanadium is usually recovered as a byproduct or coproduct and so world resources of the element are not really indicative of available supply
========
see also  categoryvanadate minerals
========
vanadium is available commercially and production of a sample in the  laboratory  is not normally required commercially routes leading to metallic vanadium as main product are not usually required as enough is produced as  byproduct  in other processes
========
in industry heating of vanadium ore or residues from other processes with  salt  nacl or  sodium carbonate  na2co3 at about 850c gives  sodium vanadate  navo3 this is dissolved in water and acidified to give a red solid which in turn is melted to form a crude form of  vanadium pentoxide  v2o5 reduction of vanadium pentoxide with  calcium  gives pure vanadium an alternative suitable for small scales is the reduction of vanadium pentachloride vcl5 with  hydrogen  or  magnesium  many other methods are also in use
========
industrially most vanadium is used as an additive to improve  steels  rather than proceed via pure vanadium metal it is often sufficient to react the crude of vanadium pentoxide v2o5 with crude  iron  this produces ferrovanadium suitable for further work
========
 vanadium pentoxide  v2o5 is used as a catalyst principally in the production of sulfuric acid it is the source of vanadium used in the manufacture of ferrovanadium it can be used as a dye and colorfixer
========
vanadyl sulfate voso4 also called  vanadiumiv sulfate  oxide hydrate is used as a relatively controversial  dietary supplement  primarily for increasing  insulin  sensitivity and  bodybuilding  whether it works for the latter purpose has not been proven and there is some evidence that athletes who take it are merely experiencing a  placebo effect
