the toxicity of vanadium depends on its physicochemical state particularly on its valence state and solubility tetravalent voso4 has been reported to be more than 5 times as toxic as trivalent v2o3 roschin 1967 vanadium compounds are poorly absorbed through the gastrointestinal system inhalation exposures to vanadium and vanadium compounds result primarily in adverse effects to the respiratory system sax 1984 atsdr 1990 ress et al 2003 worleknirsch et al 2007 quantitative data are however insufficient to derive a subchronic or chronic inhalation reference dose other effects have been reported on blood parameters after oral or inhalation exposures scibior et al 2006 gonzalezvillalva et al 2006 on liver kobayashi et al 2006 neurological development in rats soaso and garcia 2007 and other organs
========
there is little evidence that vanadium or vanadium compounds are reproductive toxins or teratogens  vanadium pentoxide was reported to be carcinogenic in male rats and male and female mice by inhalation in an ntp study ress et al 2003 although the interpretation of the results has recently been disputed duffus 2007  vanadium has not been classified as to carcinogenicity by the us epa 1991a
========
it is known that vanadium gets the oxidation states 2 3 4 5
to observe the colours of these states  ammonium metavanadate  nh4vo3 can be used as a starting agent
it must be acidified beforehand so dioxovanadiumv ion vo2 yellow 5 oxidation number is produced in alkaline medium the stable form of vanadiumv state is vo3
========
adding  zinc  powder and concentrated  hydrochloric acid  continuously vo2 is reduced into blue vo2
========
it can be seen that during the reaction the mixture is green in colour as the original yellow of the 5 state and the blue of the 4 are present
========
continuously adding zn powder and concentrated hcl blue vo2 is reduced to green v3 v3 is then reduced to violet v2 by zn powder and concentrated hcl again

naturally occurring vanadium is composed of one stable  isotope  51v and one radioactive isotope 50v with a  halflife  of 151017 years 24 artificial  radioisotopes  have been characterized in the range of  mass number  between 40 and 65 with the most stable being 49v with a halflife of 330 days and 48v with a halflife of 159735 days  all of the remaining  radioactive  isotopes have halflives shorter than an hour the majority of them below 10 seconds in 4 isotopes  metastable excited states  were found including 2 metastable states for 60v
========
the primary  decay mode  before the most abundant stable isotope 51v is  electron capture  the next most common mode is  beta decay  the primary  decay products  before 51v are element 22  titanium  isotopes and the primary products after are element 24  chromium  isotopes
========
powdered metallic vanadium is a fire hazard and unless known otherwise all vanadium compounds should be considered highly toxic generally the higher the oxidation state of vanadium the more toxic the compound is the most dangerous compound is  vanadium pentoxide
========
the  occupational safety and health administration  osha has set an exposure limit of 005 mgm3 for vanadium pentoxide dust and 01 mgm3 for vanadium pentoxide fumes in workplace air for an 8hour workday 40hour work week
========
the  national institute for occupational safety and health  niosh has recommended that 35 mgm3 of vanadium be considered immediately dangerous to life and health this is the exposure level of a chemical that is likely to cause permanent health problems or death
