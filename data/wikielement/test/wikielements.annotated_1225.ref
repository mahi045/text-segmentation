historically one of the largest releases was from the colex plant a lithiumisotope separation plant at oak ridge the plant operated in the 1950s and 1960s records are incomplete and unclear but government commissions have estimated that some two million pounds of mercury are unaccounted for
========
one of the worst  industrial disasters  in history was caused by the dumping of mercury compounds into  minamata  bay japan the  chisso corporation  a  fertilizer  and later petrochemical company was found responsible for polluting the bay from 1932ndash1968 it is estimated that over 3000 people suffered various deformities severe mercury poisoning symptoms or death from what became known as  minamata disease

mercury is used primarily for the manufacture of industrial chemicals or for electrical and electronic applications it is used in some  thermometers  especially ones which are used to measure high temperatures in the united states nonprescription sale of mercury fever thermometers is banned by a number of different states and localities other uses
 mercury was used inside  wobbler fishing  lures its heavy liquid form made it useful since the lures made an attractive irregular movement when the mercury moved inside the plug such use was stopped due to environmental concerns but illegal preparation of modern fishing plugs has occurred
 mercury  sphygmomanometers
 mercury  barometers   diffusion pumps   coulometers  and many other laboratory instruments as an opaque liquid with a high density and a nearly linear thermal expansion it is ideal for this role
 the  triple point  of mercury 388344 c is a fixed point used as a temperature standard for the international temperature scale  its90
 in some gaseous  electron tubes  including  ignitrons   thyratrons  and  mercury arc rectifiers
 gaseous mercury is used in  mercuryvapour lamps  and some  neon sign  type advertising signs and  fluorescent lamps
 mercury is used to construct  liquidmirror telescopes  the mirror is formed by rotating liquid mercury on a disk the parabolic form of the liquid thus formed reflecting and focusing incident light such telescopes are cheaper than conventional large mirror telescopes by up to a factor of 100 but the mirror cannot be tilted and always points straight up
 liquid mercury was sometimes used as a  coolant  for  nuclear reactors  however  sodium  is proposed for reactors cooled with liquid metal because the high density of mercury requires much more energy to circulate as coolant
 liquid mercury has been proposed as a working fluid for a  heat pipe  type of cooling device for spacecraft heat rejection systems or radiation panels
 mercury was a propellant for early  ion engines  in  electric propulsion  systems  advantages were mercurys high molecular weight low ionization energy low dualionization energy high liquid density and liquid storability at  room temperature   disadvantages were concerns regarding environmental impact associated with ground testing and concerns about eventual cooling and condensation of some of the propellant on the spacecraft in longduration operations  the first spaceflight to use electric propulsion was a mercuryfueled ion thruster  sert1  launched by  nasa  at  nasas wallops flight facility  in 1964  sert stands for  space electric rocket test   the sert1 flight was followed up by the sert2 flight in 1970  mercury and  cesium  were preferred propellants for ion engines until  hughes research laboratory  performed studies finding  xenon  gas to be suitable replacement  xenon is now the preferred propellant for ion engines as it has a high molecular weight little or no reactivity due its  noble gas  nature and has a high liquid density under mild cryogenic storage
 experimental  mercury vapour turbines  were proposed to increase the efficiency of fossilfuel electrical power plants
 mercury was once used in the  amalgamation  process of refining  gold  and  silver   ores  this polluting practice is still used by the garimpeiros gold miners of the  amazon basin  in  brasil  and by  illegal miners  in  south africa
 mercury is still used in some cultures for  folk medicine  and ceremonial purposes which may involve  ingestion   injection  or the sprinkling of elemental mercury around the home it must be emphasized that the former two procedures especially are extremely hazardous and the latter is nearly as so because mercury spreads easily and is therefore ingested
  alexander calder  built a  mercury fountain  for the spanish pavilion at the 1937  worlds fair  in paris the fountain is now on display at the  fundació joan miró  in  barcelona
 used in  electrochemistry  as part of a secondary reference  electrode  called the  calomel electrode  as an alternative to the  standard hydrogen electrode  this is used to work out the  electrode potential  of  half cells
 used in  cold cathode  also generalised under the neon sign industry lighting to increase the success of  ionization  and  conductivity  in  argon  filled lamps an  argon  filled lamp without mercury will have dull spots and will fail to light correctly lighting containing mercury can only be  bombarded oven pumped once when added to  neon  filled tubes the light produced will be inconsistent redblue spots until the initial burningin process is completed eventually it will light a consistent dull offblue colour
 mercury was once used as a gun barrel bore cleaner
miscellaneous uses  mercury switches  including  home mercury light switches  installed prior to 1970 tilt switches used in old fire detectors tilt switches in many modern home thermostats  electrodes  in some types of  electrolysis   batteries   mercury cells  including for  sodium hydroxide  and  chlorine  production handheld games and  alkaline batteries   catalysts   insecticides   dental amalgams preparations and  liquid mirror  telescopes

 chlorine  is produced from  sodium chloride  common salt nacl using  electrolysis  to separate the metallic  sodium  from the chlorine gas usually the salt is dissolved in water to produce a brine byproducts of any such  chloralkali process  are caustic soda  sodium hydroxide  naoh and hydrogen h2 by far the largest use of mercury in the late 1900s was in the mercury cell process also called the  castnerkellner process  where  metallic sodium  is formed as an  amalgam  at a  cathode  made from mercury this sodium is then reacted with water to produce sodium hydroxide many of the industrial mercury releases of the 1900s came from this process although modern plants claimed to be safe in this regard
========
the element mercury is the main ingredient in  dental amalgams  controversy over the  health effects  from the use of mercury amalgams began shortly after its introduction into the western world nearly 200 years ago   in 1845 the  american society of dental surgeons  concerned about mercury poisoning asked its members to sign a pledge that they would not use amalgam    the asds disbanded in 1865    the  american dental association  formed three years after and currently takes the position that amalgam is a valuable viable and safe choice for dental patients in 1993 the  united states public health service  reported that amalgam fillings release small amounts of mercury vapor but in such a small amount that it has not been shown to cause any  adverse health effects this position is not shared by all governments    and there is an ongoing  dental amalgam controversy  a recent review by an fdaappointed advisory panel rejected by a margin of 137 the current fda report on amalgam safety   stating the reports conclusions were unreasonable given the quantity and quality of information currently available panelists said remaining uncertainties about the risk of socalled silver fillings demanded further research in particular on the effects of mercuryladen fillings on children and the fetuses of pregnant women with fillings and the release of mercury vapor on insertion and removal of mercury fillings

 mercuryi chloride  also known as  calomel  or mercurous chloride has traditionally been used as a  diuretic  topical  disinfectant  and  laxative   mercuryii chloride  also known as mercuric chloride or corrosive sublimate was once used to treat  syphilis  along with other mercury compounds although it is so toxic that sometimes the symptoms of its toxicity were confused with those of the syphilis it was believed to treat it was also used as a disinfectant  blue mass  a pill or syrup in which mercury is the main ingredient was prescribed throughout the 1800s for numerous conditions including constipation depression childbearing and toothaches in the early 20th century mercury was administered to children yearly as a laxative and dewormer and it was used in teething powders for infants the mercury containing organohalide  mercurochrome  is still widely used but has been banned in some countries such as the us
========
since the 1930s some  vaccines  have contained the preservative  thiomersal  which is metabolized or degraded to  ethyl mercury  although it was  widely speculated  that this mercurybased preservative can cause or trigger  autism  in children scientific studies showed no evidence supporting any such link nevertheless thiomersal has been removed from or reduced to trace amounts in all us vaccines recommended for children 6 years of age and under with the exception of inactivated influenza vaccine

mercury in the form of one of its common ores  cinnabar  remains an important component of  chinese   tibetan  and  ayurvedic  medicine as problems may arise when these medicines are exported to countries that prohibit the use of mercury in medicines in recent times less toxic substitutes have been devised
========
today the use of mercury in medicine has greatly declined in all respects especially in developed countries  thermometers  and  sphygmomanometers  containing mercury were invented in the early 18th and late 19th centuries respectively in the early 21st century their use is declining and has been banned in some countries states and medical institutions in 2002 the  us senate  passed legislation to phase out the sale of  nonprescription  mercury thermometers in 2003  washington  and  maine  became the first states to ban mercury blood pressure devices mercury compounds are found in some  overthecounter drugs  including topical  antiseptics  stimulant  laxatives   diaperrash   ointment   eye drops  and  nasal sprays  the  fda  has inadequate data to establish general recognition of the safety and effectiveness of the mercury ingredients in these products mercury is still used in some diuretics although substitutes now exist for most therapeutic uses
