twentyone plutonium  radioisotopes  have been characterized the most stable are pu244 with a  halflife  of 808 million years pu242 with a halflife of 373300 years and pu239 with a halflife of 24110 years all of the remaining  radioactive  isotopes have halflives that are less than 7000 years this element also has eight  meta states  though none are very stable all have halflives less than one second
========
the isotopes of plutonium range in  atomic weight  from 2280387  u  pu228 to 247074 u pu247 the primary  decay modes  before the most stable isotope pu244 are  spontaneous fission  and  alpha emission  the primary mode after is  beta emission  the primary  decay products  before pu244 are uranium and neptunium isotopes neglecting the wide range of daughter nuclei created by fission processes and the primary products after are  americium  isotopes
========

========
key isotopes for applications are pu239 which is suitable for use in nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors and pu238 which is suitable for use in  radioisotope thermoelectric generators  see above for more details  the isotope pu240 undergoes spontaneous fission very readily and is produced when pu239 is exposed to neutrons the presence of pu240 in a material limits its nuclear bomb potential since it emits neutrons randomly increasing the difficulty of initiating accurately the  chain reaction  at the desired instant and thus reducing the bombs reliability and power plutonium consisting of more than about 90 pu239 is called  weaponsgrade  plutonium plutonium obtained from commercial reactors generally contains at least 20 pu240 and is called reactorgrade plutonium
========
pu240 while of little importance by itself plays a crucial role as a contaminant in plutonium used in nuclear weapons  it spontaneously fissions at a high rate and a 1 impurity in pu239 will lead to unacceptably early initiation of a fission chain reaction in guntype atomic weapons eg the proposed  thin man  bomb blowing the weapon apart before much of its material can fission  pu240 contamination is the reason plutonium weapons must use an implosion design  a theoretical 100 pure pu239 weapon could be constructed as a guntype device but achieving this level of purity is prohibitively difficult  pu240 contamination has proven a mixed blessing to weapons designers  while it created delays and headaches during the manhattan project because of the need to develop implosion technology those very same difficulties are currently a barrier to nuclear proliferation  implosion devices are also inherently more efficient and less prone toward accidental detonation than are guntype weapons
========

all isotopes and compounds of plutonium are toxic and radioactive while plutonium is sometimes described in media reports as the most  toxic  substance known to man from the standpoint of actual chemical or radiological  toxicity  this is incorrect when taken in by mouth plutonium is less poisonous than if inhaled since it is not absorbed into the body efficiently when ingested  the us department of energy estimates the increase in lifetime cancer risk for inhaled plutonium as 3108 pci1 this means that inhaling 1μci or about 25μg of reactorgrade plutonium is estimated to increase ones lifetime risk of developing cancer as a result of the exposure to 3  when plutonium is absorbed into the body it is excreted very slowly with a  biological halflife  of 200 years
========
from a purely chemical standpoint it is about as poisonous as  lead  and other  heavy metals      not surprisingly it has a metallic taste
plutonium may be extremely dangerous when handled incorrectly the  alpha  radiation it emits does not penetrate the skin but can irradiate internal organs when plutonium is inhaled or ingested particularly at risk are the  skeleton  where it is likely to be absorbed by the bone surface and the  liver  where it will likely collect and become concentrated approximately 0008 microcuries absorbed in bone marrow is the maximum withstandable dose  anything more is considered toxic  extremely fine particles of plutonium on the order of micrograms can cause  lung cancer  if inhaled
========
other substances including  ricin   tetrodotoxin   botulinum  toxin and  tetanus  toxin are fatal in doses of sometimes far under one milligram and others the  nerve agents  the  amanita  toxin are in the range of a few milligrams as such plutonium is not unusual in terms of toxicity even by inhalation in addition those substances are fatal in hours to days whereas plutonium and other cancercausing radioactives give an increased chance of illness decades in the future considerably larger amounts may cause acute  radiation poisoning  and death if ingested or inhaled however so far no human is known to have immediately died because of inhaling or ingesting plutonium and many people have measurable amounts of plutonium in their bodies
========
in contrast to naturally occurring radioisotopes such as  radium  or  c14  plutonium was manufactured concentrated and isolated in large amounts hundreds of metric tons during the  cold war  for weapons production these stockpiles whether or not in weapons form pose a significant problem because unlike chemical or biological agents no chemical process can destroy them one proposal to dispose of surplus weaponsgrade plutonium is to mix it with highly radioactive isotopes eg spent reactor fuel to deter handling by potential thieves or terrorists another is to mix it with uranium and use it to fuel nuclear power reactors the mixed oxide or  mox  approach this would not only fission and thereby destroy much of the pu239 but also transmute a significant fraction of the remainder into pu240 and heavier isotopes that would make the resulting mixture useless for nuclear weapons
========
toxicity issues aside care must be taken to avoid the accumulation of amounts of plutonium which approach  critical mass  particularly because plutoniums critical mass is only a third of that of uranium235s despite not being confined by external pressure as is required for a nuclear weapon it will nevertheless heat itself and break whatever confining environment it is in shape is relevant compact shapes such as spheres are to be avoided plutonium in solution is more likely to form a critical mass than the solid form due to moderation by the hydrogen in water a weaponscale nuclear explosion cannot occur accidentally since it requires a greatly supercritical mass in order to explode rather than simply melt or fragment however a marginally critical mass will cause a lethal dose of radiation and has in fact done so in the past on several occasions
========
 criticality accidents  have occurred in the past some of them with lethal consequences careless handling of tungsten carbide bricks around a 62 kg plutonium sphere resulted in a lethal dose of radiation at  los alamos  on  august 21   1945  when scientist  harry k daghlian jr  received a dose estimated to be 510  rems  51  sv  and died four weeks later nine months later another los alamos scientist  louis slotin  died from a similar accident involving a beryllium reflector and the same plutonium core the socalled  demon core  that had previously claimed the life of daghlian these incidents were fictionalized in the 1989 film  fat man and little boy  in 1958 during a process of purifying plutonium at los alamos a critical mass was formed in a mixing vessel which resulted in the death of a crane operator other accidents of this sort have occurred in the  soviet union   japan  and many other countries see  list of nuclear accidents  the 1986  chernobyl accident  caused a  minor release of plutonium
========
metallic plutonium is also a fire hazard especially if the material is finely divided it reacts chemically with oxygen and water which may result in an accumulation of  plutonium hydride  a  pyrophoric  substance that is a material that will ignite in air at room temperature plutonium expands considerably in size as it oxidizes and thus may break its container the radioactivity of the burning material is an additional hazard magnesiumoxide sand is the most effective material for extinguishing a plutonium fire it cools the burning material acting as a  heat sink  and also blocks off oxygen there was a major plutoniuminitiated fire at the  rocky flats plant  near  boulder   colorado  in 1969 to avoid these problems special precautions are necessary to store or handle plutonium in any form generally a dry  inert  atmosphere is required
