large stockpiles of weaponsgrade plutonium were built up by both the  soviet union  and the  united states  during the  cold war   the us reactors at  hanford  and the  savannah river site  in south carolina produced 103000 kg it was estimated there are another 170000 kg of military plutonium in russia with 300000 kg accumulated worldwide  since the end of the cold war these stockpiles have become a focus of  nuclear proliferation  concerns in 2002 the  united states department of energy  took possession of 34 metric tons of excess weaponsgrade plutonium stockpiles from the  united states department of defense  and as of early 2003 was considering converting several nuclear power plants in the us from  enriched uranium  fuel to  mox fuel  as a means of disposing of plutonium stocks

during the initial years after the discovery of plutonium when its biological and physical properties were very poorly understood a series of  human radiation experiments  were performed by the us government and by private organizations acting on its behalf during and after the end of world war ii scientists working on the  manhattan project  and other nuclear weapons research projects conducted studies of the effects of plutonium on laboratory animals and human subjects in the case of human subjects this involved injecting solutions containing typically five micrograms of plutonium into hospital patients thought to be either terminally ill or to have a life expectancy of less than ten years either due to age or chronic disease condition these eighteen injections were made without the  informed consent  of those patients and were not done with the belief that the injections would heal their conditions rather they were used to develop diagnostic tools for determining the uptake of plutonium in the body for use in developing safety standards for people working with plutonium during the course of developing nuclear weapons
========
the episode is now considered to be a serious breach of medical ethics and of the  hippocratic oath  and has been sharply criticised as failing both the test of our national values and the test of humanity more sympathetic commentators have noted that while it was definitely a breach in trust and ethics the effects of the plutonium injections were not as damaging to the subjects as the early news stories painted nor were they so inconsequential as many scientists then and now believe
========
while almost all plutonium is manufactured synthetically extremely tiny trace amounts are found naturally in  uranium  ores these come about by a process of  neutron capture  by 238u nuclei initially forming 239u two subsequent  beta decays  then form 239pu with a 239 np  intermediary which has a halflife of 24110 years this is also the process used to manufacture 239pu in  nuclear reactors  some traces of 244pu remain from the birth of the solar system from the waste of supernovae because its halflife of 80 million years is fairly long
========
a relatively high concentration of plutonium was discovered at the  natural nuclear fission reactor  in  oklo   gabon  in 1972 since 1945 approximately 7700 kg has been released onto  earth  through  nuclear explosions
========
the activation  cross section  for 239pu is 270  barns  while the fission cross section is 747 barns for thermal neutrons the higher plutonium isotopes are created when the uranium fuel is used for a long time it is the case that for high burnup used fuel that the concentrations of the higher plutonium isotopes will be higher than the low burnup fuel which is reprocessed to obtain bomb grade plutonium

plutonium239 is one of the three  fissile  materials used for the production of  nuclear weapons  and in some  nuclear reactors  as a source of energy the other fissile materials are  uranium235  and  uranium233  plutonium239 is virtually nonexistent in nature it is made by bombarding  uranium238  with neutrons in a nuclear reactor uranium238 is present in quantity in most reactor fuel hence plutonium239 is continuously made in these reactors since plutonium239 can itself be split by  neutrons  to release energy plutonium239 provides a portion of the energy generation in a nuclear reactor

========
it is clear to see that with a low flux of neutrons that 238u will be converted into 239pu

========

there are small amounts of pu238 in the plutonium of usual plutoniumproducing reactors however isotopic separation would be quite expensive compared to another method when a u235 atom captures a neutron it is converted to an excited state of u236 some of the excited u236 nuclei undergo fission but some decay to the ground state of u236 by emitting gamma radiation further neutron capture creates u237 which has a halflife of 7 days and thus quickly decays to  np 237 since nearly all neptunium is produced in this way or consists of isotopes which decay quickly one gets nearly pure np237 by chemical separation of neptunium after this chemical separation np237 is again irradiated by reactor neutrons to be converted to np238 which decays to pu238 with a halflife of 2 days

plutonium reacts readily with  oxygen  forming puo and  puosub2sub  as well as intermediate oxides it reacts with the  halogens  giving rise to compounds such as pux3 where x can be f cl br or i  pufsub4sub  and puf6 are also seen the following oxyhalides are observed puocl puobr and puoi it will react with  carbon  to form puc  nitrogen  to form  pun  and  silicon  to form pusi2
========
plutonium like other actinides readily forms a dioxide plutonyl core puo2  in the environment this plutonyl core readily complexes with carbonate as well as other oxygen moieties oh no2 no3 and so42 to form charged complexes which can be readily mobile with low affinities to soil

========
puo2 formed from neutralizing highly acidic nitric acid solutions tends to form polymeric puo2 which is resistant to complexation  plutonium also readily shifts valences between the 3 4 5 and 6 states  it is common for some fraction of plutonium in solution to exist in all of these states in equilibrium
========

even at ambient pressure plutonium occurs in a variety of  allotropes   these allotropes differ widely in crystal structure and density the α and δ allotropes differ in density by more than 25 at constant pressure
========
the presence of these many allotropes makes machining plutonium very difficult as it changes state very readily  the reasons for the complicated phase diagram are not entirely understood recent research has focused on constructing accurate computer models of the  phase transitions
