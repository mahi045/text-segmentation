an inherited condition called  wilsons disease  causes the body to retain copper since it is not excreted by the  liver  into the  bile  this disease if untreated can lead to  brain  and  liver  damage in addition studies have found that people with mental illnesses such as  schizophrenia  had heightened levels of copper in their systems however it is unknown at this stage whether the copper contributes to the mental illness whether the body attempts to store more copper in response to the illness or whether the high levels of copper are the result of the mental illness
========
too much copper in water has also been found to damage marine life the observed effect of these higher concentrations on fish and other creatures is damage to gills liver kidneys and the nervous system it also interferes with the sense of smell in fish thus preventing them from choosing good mates or finding their way to mating areas
========
the metal when powdered is a  fire hazard  at concentrations higher than 1 mgl copper can stain clothes and items washed in water

========
praseodymium    or    is a  chemical element   that has the symbol pr and  atomic number  59
========
praseodymium is a soft silvery  metal  in the  lanthanide  group it is somewhat more resistant to  corrosion  in air than  europium   lanthanum   cerium  or  neodymium  but it does develop a green  oxide  coating that  spalls  off when exposed to air exposing more metal to  oxidation  for this reason praseodymium should be stored under a light  mineral oil  or sealed in glass
========
uses of praseodymium
========
 cubic zirconia with no coloring  although most compounds are green
 as an  alloying  agent with  magnesium  to create highstrength metals that are used in  aircraft engines
 praseodymium forms the core of  carbon arc lights  which are used in the  motion picture industry  for  studio  lighting and  projector  lights
 praseodymium  compounds   give  glasses  and  enamels  a yellow color
 praseodymium is used to color  cubic zirconia  yellowgreen to simulate  peridot
 praseodymium is a component of  didymium  glass which is used to make certain types of  welder s and  glass blower s goggles
 the group of dr  matthew sellars  of the laser physics centre at the  australian national university  in canberra australia  slowed down a light pulse  to a few hundred meters per second using praseodymium mixed with silicate crystal
 praseodymium alloyed with  nickel  prni5 has such a strong  magnetocaloric effect  that it has allowed scientists to approach within one thousandth of a degree of  absolute zero
 doping praseodymium in fluoride glass can be used as single mode fiber amplifier
 praseodymium oxide in solid solution with ceria or with ceriazirconia have been used as oxidation catalysts
========
the name praseodymium comes from the  greek  prasios meaning green and didymos twin praseodymium is frequently  misspelled  as praseodynium
========
in  1841  mosander extracted the rare earth  didymium  from  lanthana  in  1874   per teodor cleve  concluded that didymium was in fact two elements and in  1879   lecoq de boisbaudran  isolated a new earth  samarium  from didymium obtained from the mineral  samarskite  in  1885  the  austrian   chemist  baron  carl auer von welsbach  separated didymium into two elements praseodymium and  neodymium  which gave  salts  of different  colors
========
leo moser not to be confused with  leo moser  a mathematician investigated the use of praseodymium in glass coloration in the late 1920s the result was a yellowgreen glass given the name prasemit  however a similar color could be achieved with colorants costing only a minute fraction of what praseodymium cost in the late 1920s such that the color was not popular few pieces were made and examples are now extremely rare  moser also blended praseodymium with neodymium to produce heliolite glass heliolit in  german  which was more widely accepted  the first enduring commercial use of praseodymium which continues today is in the form of a yelloworange stain for ceramics praseodymium yellow which is a solidsolution of praseodymium in the  zirconium silicate  zircon lattice  this stain has no hint of green in it  by contrast at sufficiently high loadings praseodymium glass is distinctly green rather than pure yellow
========
praseodymium has historically been a rare earth whose supply has exceeded demand unwanted as such much praseodymium has been marketed as a mixture with lanthanum and cerium or lcp for the first letters of each of the constituents for use in replacing the traditional lanthanide mixtures that were inexpensively made from monazite or bastnaesite  lcp is what remains of such mixtures after the desirable neodymium and all the heavier rarer and more valuable lanthanides have been removed by solvent extraction  however as technology progresses praseodymium has been found possible to incorporate into neodymiumironboron magnets thereby extending the supply of the much in demand neodymium so lc is starting to replace lcp as a result
========
praseodymium is available in small quantities in earths crust 95  ppm  it is found in the rare earth minerals  monazite  and  bastnasite  typically comprising about 5 of the lanthanides contained therein and can be recovered from bastnasite or monazite by an  ion exchange  process or by countercurrent solvent extraction
