ytterbium    is a  chemical element  with the symbol yb and  atomic number  70 a soft silvery metallic element ytterbium is a  rare earth  of the  lanthanide series  and is found in the minerals  gadolinite   monazite  and  xenotime  the element is sometimes associated with  yttrium  or other related elements and is used in certain  steels  natural ytterbium is a mix of seven stable  isotopes
========
ytterbium is a soft  malleable  and rather  ductile  element that exhibits a bright silvery  luster   a rare earth element it is easily attacked and dissolved by  mineral acids  slowly  reacts  with  water  and  oxidizes  in air
========
ytterbium has three  allotropes  which are called alpha beta and gamma and whose transformation points are at minus13  c  and 795 c the beta form exists at room temperature and has a facecentered  crystal structure  while the hightemperature gamma form has a bodycentered crystal structure
========
normally the beta form has a  metallic like  electrical conductivity  but becomes a  semiconductor  when exposed to around 16000  atm  16  gpa  its electrical  resistivity  is tenfold larger at about 39000 atm 39 gpa but then drops dramatically to around 10 of its room temperature resistivity value at 40000 atm 4 gpa
========
ytterbium is one of the lanthanides that is able to become divalent like the other potentially divalent lanthanides samarium and europium it is capable of being extracted into mercury by the use of sodium amalgam which made it one of the easier lanthanides to purify using classical techniques  however this divalency was not discovered until the 20th century
========
usually very small anount of yb is used either small sample of radioactive isotope as source of  xrays
or small concentration dopant
========
the 169yb  isotope  has been used as a  radiation  source substitute for a portable  xray  machine when  electricity  was not available like xrays  gamma rays  pass through soft tissues of the body but are blocked by bones and other dense materials thus small 169yb samples which emit gamma rays act like tiny xray machines useful for  radiography  of small objects
========
ytterbium could also be used to help improve the grain refinement strength and other mechanical properties of  stainless steel  some ytterbium  alloys  have been used in  dentistry
========
yb is used as dopant in  optics materials  usially in the form of  ions  in  active laser media  several powerful  doubleclad fiber  lasers and  disk lasers  use  yb3 ions as  dopant  at concentration of several  atomic percent  glasses optical fibers crystals and ceramics with yb3 are used
========
ytterbium is often used as a  doping material  as yb3 for high power and wavelengthtunable  solid state lasers   yb lasers commonly radiate in the 106112µm band
being optically pumped at wavelength 900nm  1µm dependently on the ghost and application
small  quantum defect  makes yb prospective dopant for efficient lasers and  power scaling
========
the kinetic of excitations in ybdoped materials is simple and can be described within concept of  effective crosssections  for the most of ybdoped laser materials the  mccumber relation  holds
 although the application to the ybdoped  composite materials  was under discussion
========
usually low concentrtations of yb are used at high concentration of excitaitons the
ybdoped materials show  photodarkening
glass fibers
or ever switch to the broadband emission  crystals and ceramics instead of the efficient laser action
========
ytterbium has a single  absorption band  at 985  nanometers  which is used to convert  infrared  energy into electricity in  solar cells
========
ytterbium was  discovered  by the swiss chemist  jean charles galissard de marignac  in  1878  marignac found a new component in the earth then known as  erbia  and named it ytterbia after  ytterby  the swedish town where he found the new erbia component he suspected that ytterbia was a compound of a new element he called ytterbium
========
in  1907  the french chemist  georges urbain  separated marignacs ytterbia into two components neoytterbia and lutecia neoytterbia would later become known as the element ytterbium and lutecia would later be known as the element  lutetium   auer von welsbach  independently isolated these elements from ytterbia at about the same time but called them aldebaranium and cassiopeium
========
the chemical and physical properties of ytterbium could not be determined until  1953  when the first nearly pure ytterbium was produced
========
ytterbium is found with other  rare earth elements  in several rare  minerals  it is most often recovered commercially from  monazite  sand 003 ytterbium the element is also found in  euxenite  and  xenotime  ytterbium is normally difficult to separate from other rare earths but  ionexchange  and  solvent extraction  techniques developed in the late  20th century  have simplified separation  known  compounds  of ytterbium are raremdashthey havent been well characterized yet
