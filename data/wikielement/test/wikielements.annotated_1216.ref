the isotopes of ytterbium range in  atomic weight  from 1479674  u  yb148 to 1809562 u yb181 the primary  decay mode  before the most abundant stable isotope yb174 is  electron capture  and the primary mode after is  beta emission  the primary  decay products  before yb174 are element 69  thulium  isotopes and the primary products after are element 71  lutetium  isotopes  of interest to modern  quantum optics  the different ytterbium isotopes follow either  boseeinstein statistics  or  fermidirac statistics  leading to interesting behavior in  optical lattices
========
although ytterbium is fairly stable it nevertheless should be stored in closed containers to protect it from air and moisture all compounds of ytterbium should be treated as highly  toxic  although initial studies appear to indicate that the danger is limited ytterbium compounds are however known to cause  skin  and  eye  irritation and may be   teratogenic  metallic ytterbium dust poses a  fire  and  explosion  hazard

zinc    from    is a  metallic   chemical element  with the symbol zn and  atomic number  30 in some historical and sculptural contexts it is or was known as spelter
========
zinc is a moderately reactive blue gray  metal  that tarnishes in moist air and burns in air with a bright bluishgreen flame giving off plumes of  zinc oxide  it reacts with  acids   alkalis  and other nonmetals if not completely pure zinc reacts with dilute acids to release  hydrogen  the one common  oxidation state  of zinc is 2 from 100 c to 210 c    to    zinc metal is malleable and can easily be beaten into various shapes above       the metal becomes brittle and will be pulverized by beating zinc is nonmagnetic

========
in ancient  india  the production of zinc metal was very common many mine sites of zawar mines near udaipur rajasthan zawarmaala  were active even during 13001000 bc there are references of medicinal uses of zinc in the  charaka samhita  300 bc the  rasaratna samuccaya  800 ad explains the existence of two types of ores for zinc metal one of which is ideal for metal extraction while the other is used for medicinal purpose    zinc alloys have been used for centuries as brass goods dating to 14001000 bc have been found in  israel  and zinc objects with 87 zinc have been found in prehistoric  transylvania  because of the low boiling point and high chemical reactivity of this metal isolated zinc would tend to go up the chimney rather than be captured the true nature of this metal was not understood in ancient times
========
the manufacture of  brass  was known to the  ebi  by about 30 bc using a technique where  calamine  and  copper  were heated together in a crucible the  zinc oxides  in calamine were reduced and the free zinc metal was trapped by the copper forming an  alloy  the resulting  calamine brass  was either cast or hammered into shape
========
smelting and extraction of impure forms of zinc was accomplished as early as 1000 ad in  india  and  china  in the west impure zinc as a remnant in melting ovens was known since antiquity but usually discarded as worthless strabo mentions it as pseudoarguros mdash mock silver the  berne zinc tablet  is a votive plaque dating to  roman gaul  probably made from such zinc remnants
========
the metallurgist  andreas libavius  received in 1597 a quantity of zinc metal in its pure form which was unknown in the west before then libavius identified it as indianmalabar lead  paracelsus  1516 was credited for the name zinc  it was regularly imported to  europe  from the orient in the 17th century but was at times very expensive
========
the isolation of metallic zinc in the west may have been achieved independently by several people
========
dr  john lane  is said to have carried out experiments probably at  landore  prior to his bankruptcy in 1726  postlewayt s universal dictionary a contemporary source giving technological information in europe did not mention zinc before 1751
========
in 1738  william champion  patented in  great britain  a process to extract zinc from calamine in a smelter using a technology somewhat similar to that used at zawar zinc mines in  rajasthan   however there is no evidence that he visited the orient
