darmstadtium    formerly called ununnilium    symbol uun or  eka  platinum  is a  chemical element  with the symbol ds and  atomic number  110  it is one of the socalled  superheavy atoms  this  synthetic element  quickly decays its  isotopes  of mass 267 to 273 have halflives measured in microseconds heavier  isotopes of darmstadtium  of mass 279 and 281 were synthesized later and are more stable with halflives of 180  milliseconds  and 111  seconds  respectively
========
darmstadtium was  first created  on  november 9   1994  at the  gesellschaft für schwerionenforschung  gsi in arheiligen a northern suburb of  darmstadt   germany  by  peter armbruster  and  gottfried münzenberg  under the direction of professer  sigurd hofmann  a few  atoms  of it were produced by a  nuclear fusion  reaction caused by bombarding a lead target with nickel
========

the element was named after the place of its discovery  darmstadt  the new name was given to it by the  iupac  on  august 16   2003
========
because the telephone number of the police is 110 within germany the element has also earned the nickname of policium
========
 island of stability

roentgenium       formerly unununium    is a  chemical element  in the  periodic table  that has the symbol rg and  atomic number  111 making it one of the  superheavy atoms  it is a  synthetic element  whose longestlived  isotope  has a mass of 280 and a  halflife  of 36  seconds  due to its presence in group 11 it is a  transition metal
========
it was discovered by peter armbruster gottfried münzenber and their team working at the  gesellschaft für schwerionenforschung  gsi in  darmstadt   germany  on  december 8   1994  only three  atoms  of it were observed all 272rg by the fusion of 209 bismuth  and 64 nickel  in a  linear accelerator  nickel was bombarded onto the bismuth target
========

========
the name roentgenium was accepted as a permanent name on  november 1   2004  in honor of  wilhelm conrad röntgen  before this date the element was known under the temporary  iupac   systematic element name  unununium symbol uuu some research has referred to it as  eka  gold
========
twelve  isotopes  of roentgenium are known the longestlived of these is 280rg which decays through  alpha decay  and has a halflife of 36 seconds the shortestlived isotope is 272rg which decays through alpha decay and has a half life of 15  ms  another known isotope 279rg decays through alpha decay and has a halflife of 170 ms
