another pyrometallurgical process is flash smelting then zinc oxide is obtained usually producing zinc of lesser quality than the hydrometallurgical process zinc oxide treatment has much fewer applications but high grade deposits have been successful in producing zinc from zinc oxides and zinc carbonates using  hydrometallurgy
========
the most widely used alloy of zinc is  brass  in which copper is alloyed with anywhere from 9 to 45 zinc depending upon the type of brass along with much smaller amounts of lead and tin alloys of 8588 zinc 410 copper and 28 aluminum find limited use in certain types of machine bearings alloys of primarily zinc with small amounts of copper aluminum and magnesium are useful in  die casting  an example of this is  zinc aluminum  similar alloys with the addition of a small amount of lead can be coldrolled into sheets an alloy of 96 zinc and 4 aluminum is used to make stamping dies for low production run applications where ferrous metal dies would be too expensive

 zinc oxide  is perhaps the best known and most widely used zinc compound as it makes a good base for white pigments in paint it also finds industrial use in the rubber industry and is sold as opaque  sunscreen  a variety of other zinc compounds find use industrially such as  zinc chloride  in deodorants  zinc pyrithione  anti dandruff   shampoos   zinc sulfide  in luminescent paints and zinc methyl or  zinc diethyl  in the organic laboratory roughly one quarter of all zinc output is consumed in the form of zinc compounds

naturally occurring zinc is composed of the 5 stable  isotopes  64zn 66zn 67zn 68zn and 70zn with 64zn being the most abundant 486  natural abundance  twentyone  radioisotopes  have been characterised with the most abundant and stable being 65zn with a  halflife  of 24426 days and 72zn with a halflife of 465 hours all of the remaining  radioactive  isotopes have halflives that are less than 14 hours and the majority of these have half lives that are less than 1 second this element also has 4  meta states
========
zinc has been proposed as a  salting  material for  nuclear weapons   cobalt  is another betterknown salting material a jacket of  isotopically enriched  64zn irradiated by the intense highenergy neutron flux from an exploding thermonuclear weapon would transmute into the radioactive isotope zn65 with a halflife of 244 days and produce approximately 227  mev  of  gamma radiation  significantly increasing the radioactivity of the weapons  fallout  for several days such a weapon is not known to have ever been built tested or used
========
metallic zinc is not considered to be toxic but free zinc ions in solution like copper or iron ions are highly toxic there is also a condition called zinc shakes or zinc chills see  metal fume fever  that can be induced by the inhalation of freshly formed  zinc oxide  formed during the  welding  of  galvanized  materials excessive intake of zinc can promote deficiency in other  dietary minerals

zirconium       is a  chemical element  that has the symbol zr and has the  atomic number  40 a lustrous very corrosion resistant graywhite strong  transition metal  that resembles  titanium  zirconium is obtained mainly from the mineral  zircon  zirconium is primarily used in  nuclear reactors  especially in the cladding of the fuel rods due to its low neutroncapture  crosssection  and its resistance to  corrosion
========
zirconium is a grayishwhite  metal  lustrous and quite corrosionresistant zirconium is lighter than  steel  and its hardness is similar to  copper  when it is finely divided into a powder zirconium can spontaneously ignite in air especially at high temperatures it is much more difficult to ignite the solid metal the zirconiumzinc  alloy  becomes  magnetic  at temperatures below 35  k  the  oxidation state  of zirconium is usually 4 although 3 and 2 can also be obtained inside of chemical compounds
========
zirconium from  syriac  zargono  arabic  zarkûn from  persian  zargûn زرگون meaning gold like was  discovered  in  1789  by  martin heinrich klaproth  and it was isolated in  1824  by  jöns jakob berzelius
========
the zirconiumcontaining  mineral  zircon or its variations jargon hyacinth jacinth or ligure were mentioned in biblical writings the mineral was not known to contain a new element until klaproth analyzed a jargon from the island of ceylon in the indian ocean he named the new element  zirkonertz zirconia the impure metal was isolated first by berzelius by heating a mixture of potassium and potassiumzirconium fluoride in a small decomposition process conducted in an iron tube pure zirconium wasnt prepared until 1914
========
the  crystal bar process  or iodide process discovered by  anton eduard van arkel  and jan hendrik de boer in 1925 was the first industrial process for the commercial production of pure metallic zirconium it was later superseded by the  kroll process
========


zirconium is never found in nature as a native metal the principal economic source of zirconium is the zirconium  silicate mineral   zircon  zrsio4 which is found in deposits located in  australia   south africa  and the  united states  as reported by the  british geological survey  it is extracted either as a dark sooty powder or as a gray metallic crystalline substance zirconium and  hafnium  are contained in zircon at a ratio of about 50 to 1 and they are quite difficult to separate chemically  zircon is a coproduct or byproduct of the mining and processing of heavymineral sands for the  titanium  minerals  ilmenite  and  rutile  or from  tin  minerals zirconium also occurs in about 30 other recognized mineral species including  baddeleyite  this metal is commercially produced mostly by the reduction of the zirconiumiv  chloride  with  magnesium  metal in the  kroll process  commercialquality zirconium for most uses still has a content of 1 to 3 hafnium
========
this element is relativelyabundant in  stype stars  and it has been detected in the sun and in meteorites lunar rock samples brought back from several  apollo program  missions to the moon have a quite high zirconium oxide content relative to terrestrial rocks
