before the discovery of the  zinc sulfide   flotation  technique  calamine  was the mineral source of zinc metal

========
zinc is an essential element necessary for sustaining all life it is estimated that 3000 of the hundreds of thousands of proteins in the human body contain zinc  prosthetic groups  one type of which is the socalled  zinc finger  in addition there are over a dozen types of cells in the human body that secrete zinc ions and the roles of these secreted zinc signals in medicine and health are now being actively studied zinc  ions  are now considered  neurotransmitters  cells in the salivary gland prostate immune system and intestine are other types that secrete zinc
========
zinc is an activator of certain enzymes such as  carbonic anhydrase  carbonic anhydrase is important in the transport of carbon dioxide in vertebrate blood it is also required in plants for leaf formation the synthesis of indole acetic acid auxin and anaerobic respiration alcoholic fermentation
========
zinc is found in oysters and to a far lesser degree in most animal proteins beans nuts almonds whole grains pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds
a  turkey s neck and  beef s chuck or shank also contain good amounts of zinc  phytates  which are found in whole grain breads cereals legumes and other products have been known to decrease zinc absorption clinical studies have found that zinc combined with  antioxidants  may delay progression of agerelated  macular degeneration  significant dietary intake of zinc has also recently been shown to impede the onset of flu    soil conservation  analyzes the vegetative uptake of naturally occurring zinc in many soil types
========
the us  recommended dietary allowance  of zinc from puberty on is 11mg for males and 8mg for females with higher amounts recommended during pregnancy and lactation
========

zinc deficiency results from inadequate intake of zinc or inadequate absorption of zinc into the body signs of zinc deficiency include hair loss  skin  lesions  diarrhea  and wasting of body tissues eyesight taste smell and memory are also connected with zinc a deficiency in zinc can cause malfunctions of these organs and functions congenital abnormalities causing zinc deficiency may lead to a disease called  acrodermatitis enteropathica
========
obtaining a sufficient zinc intake during  pregnancy  and in young children is a very real problem especially among those who cannot afford a good and varied diet  brain  development is stunted by zinc insufficiency in utero and in youth
========
it is rarely recognised that lack of zinc can contribute to  acne   leukonychia  purple spots on the fingernails are often seen as an indication of zinc deficiency
========

zinc deficiency causes a decrease in  appetite   which could degenerate in anorexia nervosa an appetite disorders in turn cause  malnutrition  and notably inadequate zinc intake the use of zinc in the treatment of anorexia nervosa has been advocated since 1979 by bakan at least 15 trials showed that zinc improved weight gain in anorexia a 1994 randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled trial showed that zinc 14 mg per day doubled the rate of body mass increase in the treatment of anorexia nervosa an
deficiency of other  nutrients  such as  tyrosine  and  tryptophan  precursors of the  monoamine   neurotransmitters   norepinephrine  and  serotonin  respectively as well as vitamin b1  thiamine  could contribute to this phenomenon of malnutritioninduced malnutrition
========
even though zinc is an essential requirement for a healthy body too much zinc can be harmful excessive absorption of zinc can also suppress copper and iron absorption the free zinc ion in solution is highly toxic to plants invertebrates and even vertebrate fish the free ion activity model fiam is wellestablished in the literature and shows that just  micromolar  amounts of the free ion kills some organisms a recent example showed 6 micromolar killing 93 of all daphnia in water swallowing a post 1982 american one  cent  piece 975 zinc can also cause damage to the stomach lining due to the high solubility of the zinc ion in the acidic stomach zinc toxicity mostly in the form of the ingestion of us pennies minted after 1982 is commonly fatal in dogs where it causes a severe  hemolytic anemia   in pet parrots zinc is highly toxic and poisoning can often be fatal
========
there is evidence of induced copper deficiency at low intakes of 100300 mg znd the usda rda is 15 mg znd even lower levels closer to the rda may interfere with the utilization of copper and iron or to adversely affect cholesterol

zinc salts are effective against  pathogens  in direct application  gastroenteritis  is strongly attenuated by ingestion of zinc and this effect could be due to direct antimicrobial action of the zinc ions in the gi tract or to absorption of the zinc and rerelease from immune cells all  granulocytes  secrete zinc or both
========
in  clinical trials  both zinc gluconate and zinc gluconate glycine the formulation used in lozenges have been shown to shorten the duration of symptoms of the common cold  the amount of glycine can vary from two to twenty moles per mole of zinc gluconate

zinc is the 23rd most abundant element in the  earths crust  the most heavily mined  ores  sphalerite tend to contain roughly 10  iron  as well as 4050 zinc minerals from which zinc is extracted include  sphalerite  zinc sulfide  smithsonite  zinc carbonate  hemimorphite  zinc silicate and  franklinite  a zinc spinel
========
the earth has been estimated to have 46 years supply of zinc
========

there are zinc mines throughout the world with the largest producers being  china   australia  and  peru  in 2005 china produced almost onefourth of the global zinc output reports the  british geological survey  mines and refineries in  europe  include  umicore  in  belgium   tara  galmoy and lisheen in  ireland  and  zinkgruvan  in  sweden  zinc metal is produced using  extractive metallurgy   zinc sulfide   sphalerite  minerals are concentrated using the  froth flotation  method and then usually roasted using  pyrometallurgy  to oxidise the zinc sulfide to zinc oxide the zinc oxide is leached to zinc sulfate znso4 in several stages of increasingly stronger sulfuric acid h2so4 iron is usually rejected as  jarosite  or  goethite  removing other impurities at the same time the final purification uses zinc dust to remove  copper   cadmium  and  cobalt  in two to three different stages the metal is then extracted from the purified zinc sulfate solution by electrowinning as cathodic deposits over  aluminium  sheets zinc cathodes can be directly cast or alloyed with aluminium
========
electrolyte zinc sulfate solutions must be very pure for electrowinning to be at all efficient impurities can change the decomposition voltage enough to where the electrolysis cell produces largely hydrogen gas rather than zinc metal
========
there are two common processes for electrowinning the metal the low current density process and the tainton high current density process the former uses a 10 sulfuric acid solution as the electolyte with current density of 270325 amperes per square meter the latter uses 2228 sulfuric acid solution as the electrolyte with a current density of about 1000 amperes per square meter the latter gives better purity and has higher production capacity per volume of electrolyte but has the disadvantage of running hotter and being more corrosive to the vessel in which it is done in either of the electrolytic processes each metric ton of zinc production expends about 3900 kwh 14 mj of electric power
