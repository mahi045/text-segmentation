there are also several pyrometallurgical processes that reduce zinc oxide using carbon then distill the metallic zinc from the resulting mix in an atmosphere of carbon monoxide these include the belgiantype horizontalretort process the  new jersey zinc  continuous verticalretort process and the st joseph lead companys electrothermal process the belgian process requires redistillation to remove impurities of lead cadmium iron copper and arsenic the new jersey process employs a fractionating column which is absent in the belgian process that separates the individual impurities where they can be sold as byproducts the st joseph lead company process heats the zinc oxidecoke mixture by passing an electric current through it rather than by coal or gas fire
