========
copper metal does react with  hydrogen sulfide  and  sulfide  containing solutions a series of different copper sulfides can form on the surface of the copper metal
========

========
note that the copper sulfide area of the plot is very complex due to the existence of many different sulfides a close up is also provided to make the graph more clear it is clear that the copper is now able to corrode even without the need for oxygen as the copper is now less noble than  hydrogen  this can be observed in every day life when copper metal surfaces tarnish after exposure to air which contains sulfur compounds

========
ammonia media
========
copper does react with oxygencontaining ammonia solutions because the ammonia forms watersoluble copper complexes the formation of these complexes causes the corrosion to become more thermodynamically favored than the corrosion of copper in an identical solution that does not contain the ammonia
========

========
chloride media
========
copper does react with a combination of oxygen and hydrochloric acid to form a series of copper chlorides it is interesting to note that if copperii chloride greenblue is boiled with copper metal with little or no oxygen present then white copperi chloride will be formed

========
a single crystal copper consists of a few microns of small crystals in this form of crystal c the yield stress is high and crystal undergoes a large amount of elastic deformation before going into the plastic deformation region the plastic deformation region has an unpredictable outcome the stress level decreases significantly as necking begins to occur
========
 polycrystal copper  has many crystal of different geometries combined the plastic deformation of polycrystal is similar to mild steel copper has a high ductility and will continue to elongate as stress is applied it is very useful in copper wire drawing
========
numerous  copper alloys  exist many with important historical and contemporary uses  speculum metal  and  bronze  are alloys of copper and  tin   brass  is an alloy of copper and  zinc   monel  metal also called  cupronickel  is an alloy of copper and  nickel  while the metal bronze usually refers to coppertin alloys it also is a generic term for any alloy of copper such as  aluminium bronze  silicon bronze and manganese bronze
========
copper is germicidal via the  oligodynamic effect  for example brass doorknobs disinfect themselves of many bacteria within a period of eight hours this effect is useful in many applications

========
in 2005 chile was the top mine producer of copper with at least onethird world share followed by the usa indonesia and peru reports the  british geological survey
========
copper can be found as  native copper  in  mineral  form minerals such as the  sulfides   chalcopyrite  cufes2  bornite  cu5fes4  covellite  cus  chalcocite  cu2s are sources of copper as are the  carbonates   azurite  cu3co32oh2 and  malachite  cu2co3oh2 and the oxide  cuprite  cu2o
========
most copper ore is mined or  extracted  as copper sulfides from large  open pit mines  in  porphyry copper  deposits that contain 04 to 10 percent copper examples include  chuquicamata  in  chile  and  el chino mine  in  new mexico  the average abundance of copper found within crustal rocks is approximately 68  ppm  by mass and 22 ppm by atoms
========
the  intergovernmental council of copper exporting countries  cipec defunct since 1992 once tried to play a similar role for copper as  opec  does for  oil  but never achieved the same influence not least because the secondlargest producer the  united states  was never a member formed in 1967 its principal members were  chile   peru   zaire  and  zambia
