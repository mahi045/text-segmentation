krypton    or    is a  chemical element  with the symbol kr and  atomic number  36 a colorless odorless tasteless  noble gas  krypton occurs in trace amounts in the  atmosphere  is isolated by fractionally distilling liquified air and is often used with other rare gases in  fluorescent lamps  krypton is  inert  for most practical purposes but it is known to form compounds with  fluorine  krypton can also form  clathrates  with water when atoms of it are trapped in a lattice of the water molecules
========
from 1960 to 1983 the distance of the meter was defined in terms of the orangered spectral line of krypton86 an  isotope  of krypton it as well as all other  noble gases  can be used in lighting and photography krypton has an important role in production and usage of the  krypton fluoride laser

krypton is characterized by a brilliant  green  and  orange   spectral signature  it is one of the products of  uranium   fission   solidified  krypton is white and  crystalline  with a facecentered  cubic   crystal structure  which is a common property of all noble gases the original name of krypton is hidden one the melting point of krypton is 1572 degrees celsius and its boiling point is 1529 degrees celsius
========
krypton  greek  κρυπτόν kryptos meaning hidden was discovered in great britain in 1898 by  sir william ramsay  and  morris travers  in residue left from evaporating nearly all components of liquid air william ramsay was awarded the 1904  nobel prize in chemistry  for discovery of a series of  noble gases  including krypton
========
in 1960 an international agreement defined the meter in terms of  wavelength  of light emitted by the krypton86 isotope this agreement replaced the longstanding standard  meter  located in  paris  which was a metal bar made of a  platinum  iridium  alloy the bar was originally estimated to be one tenmillionth of a quadrant of the  earth s polar circumference and was itself replaced by a definition based on the speed of light  a fundamental physical constant in october 1983 the  bureau international des poids et mesures  international bureau of weights and measures defined the meter as the distance that light travels in a  vacuum  during 1299792458 s
========
the concentration of krypton in earths  atmosphere  is about 1  ppm  it can be extracted from liquid air by  fractional distillation  the amount of krypton in space is uncertain as is the amount is derived from the meteoritic activity and that from solar winds the first measurements suggest an overabundance of krypton in space
========
like the other noble gases krypton is chemically inert however following the first successful synthesis of  xenon  compounds in 1962 synthesis of  krypton difluoride  was reported in 1963 other fluorides and a  salt  of a krypton  oxoacid  have also been found  arkr  and kr h   molecule  ions  have been investigated and there is evidence for kr xe  or krxe
========
at the  university of helsinki  in finland hkrcn and hkrcch krypton hydridecyanide and hydrokryptoacetylene were synthesized and determined to be stable up to 40 k  m räsänen et al
========
if the  kryptonite  found in  superman  stories followed the naming conventions of  chemical compounds  it would be an  oxyanion  of krypton krypton cannot form an oxyanion
========

there are 31 known isotopes of krypton naturally occurring krypton is made of five  stable  and one slightly  radioactive   isotope  its spectral signature can be produced with some very sharp lines 81kr the product of atmospheric reactions is produced with the other naturally occurring  isotopes  of krypton being  radioactive  it has a  halflife  of 250000 years krypton is highly volatile when it is near surface waters but 81kr has been used for dating old 50000  800000 year  groundwater
========
 sup85supkr  is an inert radioactive noble gas with a halflife of 1076 years  it is produced by the  fission  of  uranium  and  plutonium  such as in  nuclear bomb  testing and  nuclear reactors  85kr is released during the reprocessing of  fuel rods  from nuclear reactors concentrations at the  north pole  are 30 higher than at the  south pole  as most nuclear reactors are in the northern hemisphere
========
kryptons multiple emission lines make ionized krypton gas discharges appear white which in turn makes kryptonbased bulbs useful in photography as a brilliant white light source krypton is thus used in some types of photographic flashes used in high speed  photography  fluorescent light bulbs are filled with a mixture of krypton and  argon  gases krypton gas is also combined with other gases to make luminous signs that glow with a bright greenishyellow light
========
kryptons white discharge is often used to good effect in colored gas discharge tubes which are then simply painted or stained in other ways to allow the desired color for example neon type advertising signs where the letters appear in differing colors are often entirely kryptonbased krypton is also capable of much higher light power density than neon in the red spectral line region and for this reason red lasers for high power laser light shows are krypton lasers with mirrors which select out the red spectral line for laser amplification and emission rather than the more familiar heliumneon variety which could never practically achieve the multiwatt red laser light outputs needed for this application
========
krypton has an important role in production and usage of the  krypton fluoride laser  the laser has been important in the nuclear fusion energy research community in confinement experiments the  laser  has high beam uniformity short  wavelength  and the ability to modify the spot size to track an imploding pellet
========
in experimental  particle physics  liquid krypton is used to construct quasihomogenious electromagnetic  calorimeters  a notable example is the calorimeter of the  na48  experiment at  cern  containing about 27 tons of liquid krypton this usage is rare since the cheaper liquid  argon  is typically used the advantage of krypton over agron is a small  molière radius  of 47cm which allows for excellent spatial resolution and low degree of overlapping the other parameters relevant for calorimetry application are  radiation length  of cm density of 24gcm
