in weapons applications plutonium is often  alloyed  with another metal eg delta phase with a small percentage of  gallium  to increase phase stability and thereby enhance workability and ease of handling  interestingly in fission weapons the explosive  shock waves  used to compress a plutonium core will also cause a transition from the usual delta phase plutonium to the denser alpha phase significantly helping to achieve  supercriticality
