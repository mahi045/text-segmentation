in late  1998  the polish theoreticist robert smolanczuk published some calculations on the fusion of atomic nuclei towards the synthesis of superheavy atoms including the element 118 his calculations suggested that it might be possible to make element 118 by fusing  lead  with  krypton  under carefully controlled conditions
========
in  1999  researchers at  lawrence berkeley national laboratory  made use of these predictions and announced the discovery of elements  116  and 118 in a paper published in  physical review letters  and very soon after the results were reported in  science  the researchers claimed to have performed the reaction

========
the following year they published a retraction after other researchers were unable to duplicate the results
in june 2002 the director of the lab announced that the original claim of the discovery of these two elements had been based on data fabricated by principal author  victor ninov   the american group had intended to name it ghiorsium after  albert ghiorso  a member of the research team before having to retract their claim
========
on  october 16   2006  researchers from  joint institute for nuclear research  jinr and  lawrence livermore national laboratory  of california usa working at the jinr in  dubna   russia  announced in  physical review  c that they had indirectly detected a total of three nuclei of ununoctium294 one in 2002 and two more in 2005 produced via collisions of  californium 249 atoms and  calcium48  ions
========


========
because of the very small fusion reaction probability the fusion  cross section  is 05 pb  51041 m2 the experiment took 4 months and involved a beam of 41019  calcium  ions that had to be shot at the  californium  target to produce the single recorded event believed to be the synthesis of the element 118
========
in the experiment the decay products of three atoms of ununoctium rather than the atoms themselves were observed a  halflife  of 089 ms was observed 294uuo decays into 290 uuh  by  alpha decay  since there were only three nuclei the halflife was derived from observed lifetimes and has a large uncertainty 089031107 ms
========

========
the identification of the 294uuo nuclei was verified by separately creating the putative daughter nucleus 290uuh by means of a bombardment of 245 cm  with 48 ca  ions
========

========
and checking that the 290uuh decay matched the decay chain of the 294uuo nuclei

========

========
although the  halflife  seems to be less than a  millisecond  it is still longer than predicted thus giving further support to the idea of  island of stability  this concept proposed by late uc berkeley professor  glenn seaborg  explains why  superheavy elements  such as element 118 last longer than predicted
========
ununoctium has all its electrons in a  closed shell  which makes it a member of the  noble gas  group therefore it is most likely that it will have similar properties as other members of the group resembling in its chemical properties the noble gas above it in the periodic table  radon  there are no known compounds of ununoctium and because it is likely to have a high  ionization energy  the most common oxidation state will likely be 0 it is believed to be a  gas  under  normal conditions
========
since only three atoms of ununoctium have ever been produced it currently has no uses outside of basic scientific research also because it does not occur at all in the  biosphere  it never presents a risk but it would constitute a  radiation hazard  if enough was ever assembled in one place
