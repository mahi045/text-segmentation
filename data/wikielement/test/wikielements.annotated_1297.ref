========
the earth has an estimated 61 years of copper reserves remaining environmental analyst  lester brown  however has suggested copper might run out within 25 years based on a reasonable extrapolation of 2 growth per year
========

========
common  oxidation states  of copper include the less stable copperi state cu and the more stable copperii state cu2 which forms blue or bluegreen salts and solutions under unusual conditions a 3 state and even an extremely rare 4 state can be obtained using old nomenclature for the naming of salts copperi is called cuprous and copperii is cupric  in  oxidation  copper is mildly  basic
========
 copperii carbonate  is green from which arises the unique appearance of copperclad roofs or domes on some buildings  copperii sulfate  forms a blue crystalline penta hydrate  which is perhaps the most familiar copper compound in the laboratory it is used as a  fungicide  known as bordeaux mixture
========
there are two stable copper oxides  copperii oxide  cuo and  copperi oxide  cu2o copper oxides are used to make  yttrium   barium  copper oxide yba2cu3o7Î´ or  ybco  which forms the basis of many  unconventional superconductors
========
copperi compounds  copperi chloride   copperi bromide   copperi iodide   copperi oxide
========
copperii compounds  copperii acetate   copperii carbonate   copperii chloride   copperii hydroxide   copperii nitrate   copperii oxide   copperii sulfate   copperii sulfide   copperii tetrafluoroborate   copperii triflate
========
copperiii compounds rare  potassium hexafluorocuprate  k3cuf6
========
copperiv compounds extremely rare  caesium hexafluorocuprate  cs2cuf6

========
add aqueous  sodium hydroxide  a blue precipitate of  copperii hydroxide  should form
========
ionic equation
========
cu2aq  2ohaq  cuoh2s
========
the full equation shows that the reaction is due to hydroxide ions deprotonating the hexaaquacopper ii complex
========
 cuh2o6 2aq  2 ohaq  cuh2o4oh2s  2 h2o l
========
adding aqueous  ammonia  causes the same precipitate to form it then dissolves upon adding excess ammonia to form a deep blue ammonia complex tetraamminecopperii
========
ionic equation
========
cuh2o4oh2s  4 nh3aq   cuh2o2nh34 2aq  2h2ol  2 ohaq
========
a more delicate test than the ammonia is the  ferrocyanide of potassium  which gives a brown precipitate with copper salts
