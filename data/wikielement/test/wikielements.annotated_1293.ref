copper has played a significant part in the history of mankind which has used the easily accessible uncompounded metal for thousands of years civilizations in places such as  iraq   china   egypt   greece   india  and the  sumerian  cities all have early evidence of using copper during the roman empire copper was principally mined on  cyprus  hence the origin of the name of the metal as cyprium metal of cyprus later shortened to cuprum  a number of countries such as  chile  and the  united states  still have sizable reserves of the metal which are extracted through large open pit mines  high demand relative to supply has caused a price spike in the 2000s
========
copper as  native copper  is one of the few metals to naturally occur as an uncompounded mineral copper was known to some of the oldest civilizations on record and has a history of use that is at least 10000 years old a copper pendant was found in what is now northern  iraq  that dates to 8700 bc by 5000 bc there are signs of copper  smelting  the refining of copper from simple copper compounds such as  malachite  or  azurite   among archaeological sites in anatolia  çatal höyük  6000 bc features native copper artifacts and smelted lead beads but no smelted copper  but  can hasan  5000 bc had access to smelted copper this site has yielded the oldest known cast copper artifact a copper  mace  head

========
copper smelting appears to have been developed independently in several parts of the world  in addition to its development in anatolia by 5000 bc it was developed in china before 2800 bc in the andes around 2000 bc in central america around 600 ad and in west africa around 900 ad copper is found extensively in the  indus valley civilization  by the 3rd millennium bc in europe  ötzi the iceman  a wellpreserved male dated to  3200 bc  was found with a coppertipped axe whose metal was 997 pure high levels of  arsenic  in his hair suggest he was involved in copper smelting there are copper and  bronze  artifacts from  sumerian  cities that date to 3000 bc and  egyptian  artifacts of copper and copper tin  alloys nearly as old in one pyramid a copper plumbing system was found that is 5000 years old the egyptians found that adding a small amount of tin made the metal easier to cast so bronze alloys were found in egypt almost as soon as copper was found in the americas production in the  old copper complex  located in present day michigan and wisconsin was dated back to between 6000 to 3000 bc
========
by 2000 bc europe was using coppertin alloys or  bronze   the use of  bronze  became so pervasive in a certain era of civilization approximately 2500 bc to 600 bc in europe that it has been named the  bronze age  the transitional period in certain regions between the preceding  neolithic  period and the bronze age is termed the  chalcolithic  copperstone with some highpurity copper tools being used alongside stone tools  brass  was known to the greeks but only became a significant supplement to bronze during the roman empire
========
in greek the metal was known by the name chalkos χαλκός copper was a very important resource for the romans greeks and other ancient peoples in roman times it became known as aes cyprium aes being the generic latin term for copper alloys such as  bronze  and other metals and cyprium because so much of it was mined in  cyprus  from this the phrase was simplified to cuprum and then eventually anglicized into the english copper copper was associated with the goddess  aphrodite  venus  in mythology and  alchemy  owing to its lustrous beauty its ancient use in producing mirrors and its association with  cyprus  which was sacred to the goddess
========

during the bronze age copper was mined in britain and ireland mainly in the following locations
 south west  county cork
 west wales eg cwmwystwyth
 north wales eg  great orme
  anglesey  parys mountain
  cheshire   alderley edge
 the  staffordshire moorlands  eg  ecton  mine
  isle of man  which is between england and northern ireland
========
at  great orme  in north wales such working extended for a depth of 70 metres at  alderley edge  in  cheshire  carbon dates have established mining at around 2280 to 1890 bc at 95 probability
========

 copper mining in the united states  began with marginal workings by native americans and some development by early spaniards native copper is known to have been extracted from sites on  isle royale  with primitive stone tools between 800 and 1600 ce   europeans were mining copper in  connecticut  as early as 1709 perhaps the oldest operating largescale copper mine was the historic elizabeth mine in vermont dating to the 1700s the liz produced copper until it was closed in 1958 westward movement also brought an expansion of copper exploitation with developments of significant deposits in  michigan  and  arizona  during the 1850s and then in  montana  during the 1860s
========
native copper was mined extensively in  michigan s  keweenaw peninsula  with the heart of extraction at the productive  quincy mine  arizona had many notable deposits including the copper queen in bisbee and the united verde in jerome the anaconda in butte montana became the nations chief copper supplier by 1886
========
copper is mined in many other areas of the united states including  utah   nevada  and  tennessee  copper is the  state mineral  for utah
========

there are two stable  isotopes  63cu and 65cu along with a couple dozen  radioisotopes  the vast majority of radioisotopes have half lives on the order of minutes or less the longest lived 67cu has a half life of 618 hours see also  isotopes of copper

========
copper has a high  electrical  and  thermal conductivity  second only to  silver  among pure metals at  room temperature
========
copper is a reddishcoloured  metal  it has its characteristic colour because of its  band structure  in its liquefied state a pure copper surface without ambient light appears somewhat greenish a characteristic shared with gold when liquid copper is in bright ambient light it retains some of its pinkish luster
========
copper occupies the same family of the periodic table as silver and gold since they each have one sorbital electron on top of a filled  electron shell  this similarity in electron structure makes them similar in many characteristics all have very high thermal and electrical conductivity and all are malleable metals
========
pure water and air
copper  is a metal that does not react with water h2o but the oxygen of the air will react slowly at room temperature to form a layer of copper oxide on copper metal
========

========
hydroxide
========
it is important to note that in contrast to the oxidation of iron by wet air that the layer formed by the reaction of air with copper has a protective effect against further corrosion on old copper roofs a green layer of copper carbonate can often be seen
