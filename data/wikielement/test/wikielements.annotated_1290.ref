according to the  island of stability  theory some nuclides around the area of 114  protons  and 184  neutrons  ie isotope uuq298 can be expected to be relatively stable in comparison to the surrounding nuclides ununquadium does not occur naturally so it is entirely synthesized in laboratories all isotopes of ununquadium synthesized so far are neutronpoor this means that they contain significantly fewer neutrons than 184 which is one of the  magic number  of neutrons that is believed to make the isotope more stable neutronpoor also indicates that the isotopes decay either by  spontaneous fission  producing a variety of radionuclides  positron emission  or  electron capture  to yield element  ununtrium   so far all three that have been made have undergone spontaneous fission in the first 0012 milliseconds and therefore have never been able to be studied
