ununpentium    is the temporary name of a  synthetic   superheavy element  in the  periodic table  that has the temporary symbol uup and has the  atomic number  115 multiple isotopes have been made by a  fusion  of  calcium  and  americium  uup288 with the most neutrons it can be referred to as  eka  bismuth
========
element 115 also falls in the center of the theoretical  island of stability  although no stable isotopes have yet been found conventional models predict that if stable isotopes of element 115 can be produced they will most likely need the  magic number  of 184 neutrons which would be uup299 the currently fabricated isotopes only had at most 173 neutrons uup288
========
on  february 2   2004    synthesis  of ununpentium and  ununtrium  were reported in  physical review  c by a team composed of  russian  scientists at  dubna  universitys  joint institute for nuclear research  and  american  scientists at the  lawrence livermore national laboratory
========
the team reported that they bombarded  americium  element 95 with  calcium  element 20 to produce four  atoms  of ununpentium element 115 these atoms they report alpha decayed to  ununtrium  element 113 in approximately 100 milliseconds the ununtrium produced then existed for 12 seconds before decaying into natural elements
========
the synthesizing of the element was also reported by scientists of japan
========
in may  2006  in the  joint institute for nuclear research  the synthesis of this element was confirmed by another method the chemical identifying on final products of decay of element
========
ununpentium is a temporary  iupac   systematic element name  element 115 is also sometimes called ekabismuth
========
for now element 115 has only been manufactured in the amount of a few atoms so the chemistry of element 115 has yet to be researched but chemistry and physics can tell us a lot about what to expect although element 115 is in the same group as  bismuth  its chemistry will probably be strongly altered by  relativistic  effects one important predicted difference from bismuth is the presence of a stable  oxidation state  of 1 and a uup ion with a chemistry similar to  tl   there has been some experimental data for other superheavy elements such as  element 112  which seems to confirm relativistic effects for superheavy elements
========
ununpentium has been theorized to be inside the  island of stability  this probably explains why it was mentioned regularly in popular culture especially in  ufo conspiracy theories  the most popular account of element 115 from  bob lazar  would require changes to a great many existing theories

ununseptium    is the temporary name of an undiscovered  chemical element  in the  periodic table  that has the temporary symbol uus and has the  atomic number  117 ununseptium can be referred to as  eka  astatine
========

========
ununseptium has not yet been discovered certain chemical properties such as bond lengths are predicted to differ from what one would expect based on periodic trends from the lighter  halogens  because of relativistic effects ununseptium may show  semimetal  properties as well
the plans for synthesis of ununseptium in nearest future exists in  joint institute for nuclear research  in  dubna   russia
