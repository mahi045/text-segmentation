argon    is a  chemical element  designated by the symbol ar  argon has  atomic number  18 and is the third element in group 18 of the  periodic table   noble gases   argon is present in the  earths atmosphere  at slightly less than 1 making it the most common noble gas on earth its full outer shell makes argon  stable and resistant to bonding with other elements its  triple point  temperature of 838058 k is a defining fixed point in the  international temperature scale of 1990
========
argon has approximately the same  solubility  in water as oxygen gas and is 25 times more soluble in water than  nitrogen  gas this highly stable chemical element is colorless odorless tasteless and nontoxic in both its liquid and gaseous forms  argon is inert under most conditions and forms no confirmed stable compounds at room temperature
========
although argon is a  noble gas  it has been found to have the capability of forming some compounds for example the creation of  argon hydrofluoride  harf a metastable compound of argon with  fluorine  and  hydrogen  has been reported by researchers at the  university of helsinki  in 2000 although the neutral groundstate chemical compounds of argon are presently limited to harf argon can form  clathrates  with  water  when atoms of it are trapped in a lattice of the water molecules also argoncontaining  ions  eg arh and  excited state complexes  eg arf are well known theoretical calculations on computers have shown several argon compounds that should be stable but for which no synthesis routes are currently known

argon  greek  αργόν meaning the lazy one in reference to its chemical inactivity was suspected to be present in air by  henry cavendish  in  1785  but was not discovered until  1894  by  lord rayleigh  and sir  william ramsay  in an experiment in which they removed all of the  oxygen  and  nitrogen  from a sample of air argon was also encountered in 1882 through independent research of hf newall and wn hartley  each observed new lines in the color spectrum of air but were unable to identify the element responsible for the lines argon became the first member of the noble gases to be discovered the symbol for argon is now ar but up until 1957 it was a

there are several different reasons why argon is used in particular applications
an  inert  gas is needed  in particular argon is the cheapest alternative when diatomic  nitrogen  is not sufficiently inert
low  thermal conductivity  is required
the electronic properties ionization andor the emission spectrum are necessary
========
other  noble gases  would probably work as well in most of these applications but argon is by far the cheapest  argon is inexpensive since it is a byproduct of the production of  liquid oxygen  and  liquid nitrogen  both of which are used on a large industrial scale  the other noble gases except helium are produced this way as well but argon is the most plentiful since it has the highest concentration in the atmosphere
the bulk of argon applications arise simply because it is inert and relatively cheap  argon is used
as a fill gas in  incandescent lighting  because argon will not react with the  filament  of  light bulbs  even at high temperatures
as an inert gas shield in many forms of  welding  including  metal inert gas welding  and  tungsten inert gas welding
for extinguishing fires where damage to equipment is to be avoided see photo
as the gas of choice for the plasma used in  icp   spectroscopy
as a nonreactive blanket in the processing of  titanium  and other reactive elements
as a protective atmosphere for growing  silicon  and  germanium   crystals  and in  partial pressure heat treat furnaces
by museum conservators to protect old materials or documents which are prone to gradual oxidation in the presence of air
to keep open bottles of wine from oxidizing and in a number of dispensing units and keeper cap systems
in winemaking to top off barrels  displacing oxygen and thus preventing the wine from turning to vinegar during the aging process
in the pharmaceutical industry to top off bottles of  intravenous  drug preparations for example intravenous  paracetamol  again displacing oxygen and therefore prolonging the drugs  shelflife
used to cool the seeker head of the us air force version of the  aim9 sidewinder  missile  the  gas is stored at high pressure  and the expansion of the gas cools the seeker
========
the next most common reason for using argon is its low thermal conductivity  it is used for  thermal insulation  in energy efficient  windows   argon is also used in technical  scuba diving  to inflate a  dry suit  because it is inert and has low thermal conductivity
========
argon is also used for the specific way it ionizes and emits light  it is used in  plasma globes  and  calorimetry  in experimental  particle physics  blue argon lasers are used in surgery to weld arteries destroy tumors and to correct eye defects  in microelectronics argon ions are used for  sputtering
========
finally there are a number of miscellaneous uses  argon39 with a half life of 269 years has been used for a number of applications primarily  ice core  and  ground water  dating the argon40 potassium 40 ratio is used in dating  igneous rocks
========
 cryosurgery  procedures such as  cryoablation  use liquified argon to destroy  cancer  cells  in surgery it is used in a procedure called argon enhanced coagulation which is a form of argon plasma beam  electrosurgery  the procedure carries a risk of producing  gas embolism  in the patient and has resulted in the death of one person via this type of accident
========

argon constitutes 0934 by volume and 129 by mass of the  earths atmosphere  and air is the primary raw material used by industry to produce purified argon products   argon is isolated from air by  fractionation  most commonly by  cryogenic   fractional distillation  a process that also produces purified  nitrogen   oxygen   neon   krypton  and  xenon
========
the  martian  atmosphere in contrast contains 16 of argon40 and 5  ppm  of argon36 the  mariner  spaceprobe flyby of the  planet   mercury  in 1973 found that mercury has a very thin atmosphere with 70 argon believed to result from releases of the gas as a decay product from radioactive materials on the planet  in 2005 the  huygens  probe also discovered the presence of argon40 on  titan  the largest moon of  saturn

argons complete octet of  electrons  indicates full s and p subshells  this full outer energy level makes argon very stable and extremely resistant to bonding with other elements  before 1962 argon and the other noble gases were considered to be chemically inert and unable to form compounds however compounds of the heavier noble gases have since been synthesized in august 2000 the first argon compounds were formed by researchers at the  university of helsinki  by shining ultraviolet light onto frozen argon containing a small amount of hydrogen fluoride  argon hydrofluoride  harf was formed it is stable up to 40  kelvins  233nbsp c
========
the discovery of  argon difluoride  arf2 was announced in 2003 but this is unconfirmed and most probably incorrect
========
the main  isotopes  of argon found on earth are 40ar 996 36ar 034 and 38ar 006 naturally occurring 40 k  with a  halflife  of 125   years decays to stable 40ar 112 by  electron capture  and  positron emission  and also to stable 40ca 888 via  beta decay  these properties and ratios are used to determine the age of  rocks
========
in the earths  atmosphere  39ar is made by  cosmic ray  activity primarily with 40ar in the subsurface environment it is also produced through  neutron capture  by 39k or  alpha emission  by  calcium  37ar is created from the decay of 40ca as a result of subsurface  nuclear explosions  it has a halflife of 35 days
========
although argon is nontoxic it does not satisfy the bodys need for oxygen and is a simple asphyxiant  people have suffocated by breathing argon by mistake
