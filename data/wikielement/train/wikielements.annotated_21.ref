currently the  solvent extraction  chemistry of americium is important as in several areas of the world  scientists  are working on reducing the medium term  radiotoxicity  of the waste from the reprocessing of used  nuclear fuel
========
see  liquidliquid extraction  for some examples of the solvent extraction of americium
========
americium dioxide is used in smoke detectors
========
americium unlike uranium does not readily form a dioxide americyl core amo2 this is because americium is very hard to oxidise above the 3 oxidation state when it is in an aqueous solution  in the environment this americyl core could complex with carbonate as well as other oxygen moieties oh no2 no3 and so42 to form charged complexes which tend to be readily mobile with low affinities to soil

a large amount of work has been done on the  solvent extraction  of americium as it is the case that americium and the other transplutonium elements are responsible for the majority of the long lived radiotoxicity of  spent nuclear fuel  it is thought that by removal of the americium and  curium  that the used fuel will only need to be isolated from man and his environment for a shorter time than that required for the isolation of untreated used fuel one recent  eu  funded project on this topic was known by the codename europart within this project  triazines  and other compounds were studied as potential extraction agents

astatine    is a  chemical element  with the symbol at and  atomic number  85 this  radioactive  element occurs naturally from  uranium235  and  uranium238  decay it is the heaviest of the  halogens
========
this highly  radioactive  element has been confirmed by  mass spectrometers  to behave chemically much like other  halogens  especially  iodine  it would probably accumulate in the  thyroid  gland like iodine though astatine is thought to be more  metallic  than iodine  researchers at the  brookhaven national laboratory  have performed experiments that have identified and measured elementary reactions that involve astatine however chemical research into astatine is limited by its extreme rarity which is a consequence of its extremely short  halflife  its most stable isotope has a halflife of around 83 hours the final product of the decay of astatine is an isotope of  lead
========
astatine is the rarest naturallyoccurring element with the total amount in earths crust estimated to be less than 1  oz  28 g at any given time this amounts to less than one teaspoon of the element  guinness world records  has dubbed the element the rarest on earth stating only around 09 oz 25  g  of the element astatine at occurring naturally  isaac asimov  in a  1957 essay  on  large numbers   scientific notation  and the size of the atom wrote that in all of north and south america to a depth of ten miles the number of astatine atoms at any time was only a  trillion
========
the existence of ekaiodine had been predicted by  mendeleev  astatine after  greek  αστατος astatos meaning unstable was first synthesized in 1940 by  dale r corson   k r mackenzie  and  emilio segrè  at the  university of california berkeley  by barraging  bismuth  with  alpha particles  an earlier name for the element was alabamine ab
========
astatine is produced by bombarding  bismuth  with energetic  alpha particles  to obtain relatively longlived 209at  211at which can then be  distilled  from the target by heating in the presence of air
========
multiple  compounds  of astatine have been synthesized in microscopic amounts and studied as intensively as possible before their inevitable radioactive disintegration while these compounds are primarily of theoretical interest they are being studied for potential use in  nuclear medicine
