carbon was discovered in prehistory and was known in the forms of  soot  and  charcoal  to the earliest  human   civilizations  diamonds were known probably as early as 2500 bce in china while carbon in the forms of  charcoal  was made around roman times by the same chemistry as it is today by heating wood in a  pyramid  covered with  clay  to exclude air

in 1722  rené a f de réaumur  demonstrated that iron was transformed into steel through the absorption of some substance now known to be carbon in 1772  antoine lavoisier  showed that diamonds are a form of carbon when he burned samples of carbon and diamond then showed that neither produced any water and that both released the same amount of  carbon dioxide  per  gram
 carl wilhelm scheele  showed that graphite which had been thought of as a form of  lead  was instead a type of carbon in 1786 the french scientists  claude louis berthollet   gaspard monge  and c a vandermonde then showed that this substance was carbon in their publication they proposed the name carbone latin carbonum for this element antoine lavoisier listed carbon as an  element  in his 1789 textbook

a new  allotrope  of carbon  fullerene  that was discovered in 1985 includes  nanostructured  forms such as  buckyballs  and  nanotubes  their discoverers received the  noble prize  in chemistry in 1996 the resulting renewed interest in new forms lead to the discovery of further exotic allotropes including  glassy carbon  and the realization that  amorphous carbon  is not strictly  amorphous

 isotopes  of carbon are  atomic nuclei  that contain six  protons  plus a number of  neutrons  varying from 2 to 16 carbon has two stable naturallyoccurring  isotopes  in 1961 the  international union of pure and applied chemistry  iupac adopted the isotope  carbon12  as the basis for  atomic weights  identification of carbon in  nmr  experiments is done with the isotope 13c

 carbon14  14c is a naturallyoccurring  radioisotope  which occurs in trace amounts on earth of up to 1 part per  trillion  00000000001 mostly confined to the atmosphere and superficial deposits particularly of  peat  and other organic materials because of its relatively short  halflife  of 5730 years 14c is virtually absent in ancient rocks but is created in the  upper atmosphere  lower  stratosphere  and upper  troposphere  by interaction of  nitrogen  with  cosmic rays  the abundance of 14c in the  atmosphere  and in living organisms is almost constant but decreases predictably in their bodies after death this principle is used in  radiocarbon dating  discovered in 1949 which has been used extensively to determine the age of carbonaceous materials with ages up to about 40000 years
========
there are 15 known isotopes of carbon and the shortestlived of these is 8c which decays through  proton emission  and  alpha decay  and has a halflife of 198739x1021  s  the exotic 19c exhibits a  nuclear halo  which means its  radius  is appreciably larger than would be expected if the  nucleus  was a  sphere  of constant  density

the  allotropes  of carbon are the different molecular configurations that pure carbon can take the three relatively wellknown allotropes of carbon are  amorphous carbon   graphite  and  diamond  several exotic allotropes have also been synthesized or discovered such as  fullerenes  which include  buckyballs   carbon nanotubes   carbon nanobuds  and  nanofibers   aggregated diamond nanorods   lonsdaleite   glassy carbon
========
the  amorphous  form is an assortment of carbon atoms in a noncrystalline irregular glassy state which is essentially  graphite  but not held in a crystalline macrostructure it is present as a powder and is the main constituent of substances such as  charcoal   lampblack   soot  and  activated carbon
========
at normal pressures carbon takes the form of  graphite  in which each atom is bonded trigonally to three others in a plane composed of fused  hexagonal  rings just like those in  aromatic hydrocarbons  the resulting network is 2dimensional and the resulting flat sheets are stacked and loosely bonded through weak  van der waals forces  this gives graphite its softness and its  cleaving  properties the sheets slip easily past one another because of the delocalization of one of the outer electrons of each atom to form a  πcloud  graphite conducts  electricity  but only in the plane of each  covalently bonded  sheet this results in a lower bulk  electrical conductivity  for carbon than for most  metals  the delocalization also accounts for the energetic stability of graphite over diamond at room temperature
========

========
at very high pressures carbon forms the more compact allotrope  diamond  having nearly twice the density of graphite here each atom is bonded  tetrahedrally  to four others thus making a 3dimensional network of puckered sixmembered rings of atoms diamond has the same  cubic structure  as  silicon  and  germanium  and thanks to the strength of the carboncarbon  bonds  is the hardest naturallyoccurring substance  in terms of resistance to scratching  contrary to the popular belief that  diamonds are forever  they are in fact thermodynamically unstable under normal conditions and transform into  graphite
========
of the other discovered allotropes  aggregated diamond nanorods  have been synthesised in 2005 and are believed to be the hardest substance known yet  carbon nanofoam  is a  ferromagnetic  allotrope discovered in 1997 it consists of a lowdensity clusterassembly of carbon atoms strung together in a loose threedimensional web in which the atoms are bonded trigonally in six and sevenmembered rings it is among the lightest known solids with a density of about 2 kgm similarly  glassy carbon  contains a high proportion of closed  porosity
========
carbon exhibits remarkable properties some paradoxical different forms include the hardest naturally occurring substance  diamond  and also one of the softest substances  graphite  known moreover it has a great affinity for  bonding  with other small  atoms  including other carbon atoms and is capable of forming multiple stable  covalent  bonds with such atoms because of these properties carbon is known to form nearly ten million different compounds the large majority of all  chemical compounds  moreover carbon has the highest  melting  sublimation  point of all elements   at  atmospheric pressure  it has no actual melting point as its  triple point  is at 10 mpa 100  bar  so it sublimates above 4000 k   thus irrespective of its allotropic form carbon remains solid at higher temperatures than the highest melting point metals such as  tungsten  or  rhenium  although thermodynamically prone to oxidation carbon resists oxidation more effectively than elements such as iron and copper that are weaker reducing agents at room temperature
========
carbon compounds form the basis of all life on  earth  and the  carbonnitrogen cycle  provides some of the energy produced by the  sun  and other  stars  although it forms an extraordinary variety of compounds most forms of carbon are comparatively unreactive under normal conditions at standard temperature and pressure it resists all but the strongest oxidizers it does not react with  sulfuric acid   hydrochloric acid   chlorine  or any alkalis at elevated temperatures carbon reacts with oxygen to form carbon oxides and will reduce such metal oxides as iron oxide to the metal this  exothermic  reaction is used in the iron and steel industry to control the carbon content of steel

carbon combines with some metals at high temperatures to form metallic carbides such as the iron carbide  cementite  in steel and  tungsten carbide  widely used as an  abrasive  and for making hard tips for cutting tools

carbon is the  fourth most abundant chemical element  in the universe by mass after hydrogen helium and oxygen carbon is abundant in the  sun   stars   comets  and in the  atmospheres  of most  planets  some  meteorites  contain microscopic diamonds that were formed when the  solar system  was still a  protoplanetary disk  microscopic diamonds may also be formed by the intense pressure and high temperature at the sites of meteorite impacts

in combination with other elements carbon is found in the earths atmosphere in quantities of approximately 810  gigatonnes  and dissolved in all water bodies approximately 36000 gigatonnes around 1900 gigatonnes are present in the  biosphere   hydrocarbons  such as  coal   petroleum  and  natural gas  contain carbon as well mdash  coal   reserves  not resources amount to around 1000 gigatonnes and  oil reserves  around 150 gigatonnes with smaller amounts of  calcium   magnesium  and  iron  carbon is a major component of very large masses  carbonate   rock   limestone   dolomite   marble  etc
