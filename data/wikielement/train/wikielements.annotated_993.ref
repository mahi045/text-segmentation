in  zone melting  also called zone refining the first silicon purification method to be widely used industrially rods of metallurgical grade silicon are heated to melt at one end  then the heater is slowly moved down the length of the rod keeping a small length of the rod molten as the silicon cools and resolidifies behind it  since most impurities tend to remain in the molten region rather than resolidify when the process is complete most of the impurities in the rod will have been moved into the end that was the last to be melted  this end is then cut off and discarded and the process repeated if a still higher purity is desired
