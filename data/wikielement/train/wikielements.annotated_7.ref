arsenic    is a  chemical element  that has the symbol as and  atomic number  33 arsenic was discovered by  albertus magnus   germany  in 1250 its atomic mass is 7492  its ionic charge is 3 its position in the periodic table is shown at right this is a notoriously poisonous  metalloid  that has many  allotropic  forms yellow molecular nonmetallic and several black and gray forms metalloids are a few that are seen three metalloidal forms of arsenic with different crystal structures are found free in nature the minerals arsenic sensu stricto and the much rarer arsenolamprite and pararsenolamprite but it is more commonly found as arsenide and arsenate compounds several hundred such mineral species are known arsenic and its compounds are used as  pesticides   herbicides   insecticides  and various  alloys
========
the most common  oxidation states  for arsenic are 3 arsenides usually alloylike intermetallic compounds 3 arsenatesiii or arsenites and most organoarsenic compounds and 5 arsenatesv the most stable inorganic arsenic oxycompounds arsenic also bonds readily to itself forming for instance asas pairs in the red sulfide  realgar  and square as43 ions in the arsenide skutterudite in the 3 oxidation state the stereochemistry of arsenic is affected by possession of a  lone pair  of  electrons
========
arsenic is very similar chemically to its predecessor  phosphorus  similar to phosphorus it forms colourless odourless crystalline  oxides as2o3 and as2o5 which are hygroscopic and readily soluble in water to form acidic solutions arsenic v acid like phosphoric acid is a weak acid like phosphorus arsenic forms an unstable gaseous hydride arsine ash3 the similarity is so great that arsenic will partly substitute for phosphorus in biochemical reactions and is thus  poisonous  however in subtoxic doses soluble arsenic compounds act as  stimulants  and were once popular in small doses as medicinals by people in the mid 18th century
========
when heated in air it  oxidizes  to  arsenic trioxide  the fumes from this reaction have an odor resembling  garlic  this odor can be detected on striking arsenide minerals such as  arsenopyrite  with a hammer arsenic and some arsenic compounds  sublimes  upon heating at atmospheric pressure converting directly to a gaseous form without an intervening liquid state the liquid state appears at 20 atmospheres and above which explains why the melting point is higher than the boiling point  elemental arsenic is found in many solid forms the yellow form is soft waxy and unstable and is made of tetrahedral as4 molecules similar to the molecules of white phosphorus the gray black or metallic forms have somewhat layered crystal structures with bonds extending throughout the crystal they are brittle  semiconductors  with a metallic luster the  density  of the yellow form is 197 gcm rhombohedral gray arsenic is much denser with a density of 573 gcm the other metalloidal forms are similarly dense
========
 lead hydrogen arsenate  has been used well into the 20th century as an  insecticide  on  fruit trees  sometimes resulting in  brain damage  to those working the sprayers and  scheeles green  a copper arsenate has even been recorded in the 19th century as a  coloring agent  in  sweets   in the last half century  monosodium methyl arsenate  msma a less toxic organic form of arsenic has replaced lead arsenates role in agriculture
========
the application of most concern to the general public is probably that of  wood  which has been treated with  chromated copper arsenate  cca or  tanalith  and the vast majority of older  pressure treated  wood cca timber is still in widespread use in many countries and was heavily used during the latter half of the 20th century as a structural and outdoor  building material  where there was a risk of  rot  or  insect  infestation in untreated timber although widespread bans followed the publication of studies which showed lowlevel leaching from insitu timbers such as childrens  playground  equipment into surrounding  soil  the most serious   risk is presented by the burning of cca timber recent years have seen fatal animal poisonings and serious human poisonings resulting from the ingestion  directly or indirectly  of wood ash from cca timber the lethal human dose is approximately 20 grams of ash scrap cca construction timber continues to be widely burnt through ignorance in both commercial and domestic fires protocols for safe disposal of cca timber are still in place only patchily there is concern in some quarters about the widespread  landfill  disposal of such timber
========
during the 18th 19th and 20th centuries a number of arsenic compounds have been used as medicines including  arsphenamine  by  paul ehrlich  and  arsenic trioxide  by thomas fowler
arsphenamine as well as  neosalvarsan  was indicated for  syphilis  and  trypanosomiasis  but has been superseded by modern  antibiotics
arsenic trioxide has been used in a variety of ways over the past 200 years but most commonly in the treatment of  cancer   the us  food and drug administration  in 2000 approved this compound for the treatment of patients with  acute promyelocytic leukemia  that is resistant to  atra  it was also used as  fowler s solution in  psoriasis
========
copper acetoarsenite was used as a green  pigment  known under many different names including  paris green  and emerald green it caused numerous  arsenic poisonings
========
other uses
 various  agricultural  insecticides termination and poisons
 used in animal feed particularly in the us as a method of disease prevention and growth stimulation
  gallium arsenide  is an important  semiconductor  material used in  integrated circuits  circuits made using the compound are much faster but also much more expensive than those made in  silicon  unlike silicon it is  direct bandgap  and so can be used in  laser diodes  and  leds  to directly convert  electricity  into  light
 also used in  bronzing  and  pyrotechny
========
occupational exposures
========
exposure to higherthanaverage levels of arsenic can occur in some occupations placing workers at risk  industries that use inorganic arsenic and its compounds include wood preservation glass production nonferrous metal alloys and electronic semiconductor manufacturing inorganic arsenic is also found in coke oven emissions associated with the smelter industry
========
the word arsenic is borrowed from the  persian  word زرنيخ zarnikh meaning yellow  orpiment  zarnikh was borrowed by  greek  as arsenikon which means masculine or potent arsenic has been known and used in  persia  and elsewhere since ancient times as the symptoms of  arsenic poisoning  were somewhat illdefined it was frequently used for  murder  until the advent of the  marsh test  a sensitive chemical test for its presence another less sensitive but more general test is the  reinsch test   due to its use by the ruling class to murder one another and its potency and discreetness arsenic has been called the poison of kings and the king of poisons
========
during the  bronze age  arsenic was often included in  bronze  which made the alloy harder socalled  arsenical bronze
========
 albertus magnus  albert the great 11931280 is believed to have been the first to isolate the
element in 1250 in 1649  johann schröder  published two ways of preparing arsenic

in the  victorian era  arsenic colourless crystalline soluble white arsenic was mixed with  vinegar  and  chalk  and eaten by women to improve the  complexion  of their faces making their skin paler to show they did not work in the fields  arsenic was also rubbed into the faces and arms of women to improve their complexion the accidental use of arsenic in the adulteration of foodstuffs led to  the bradford sweet poisoning  in 1858 which resulted in approximately 20 deaths and 200 people taken ill with arsenic poisoning
