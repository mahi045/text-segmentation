exposure to nickel metal and soluble compounds should not exceed 005nbspmgcm in nickel equivalents per 40hour work week nickel sulfide fume and dust is believed to be  carcinogenic  and various other nickel compounds may be as well
 nickel carbonyl   nico4  is an extremely toxic gas the toxicity of metal carbonyls is a function of both the toxicity of a metal as well as the carbonyls ability to give off highly toxic  carbon monoxide  gas and this one is no exception  it is explosive in air
========
 sensitised  individuals may show an  allergy  to nickel affecting their skin also known as  dermatitis  the amount of nickel which is allowed in products which come into contact with human skin is regulated by the  european union  in 2002 researchers found amounts of nickel being emitted by 1 and 2  euro  coins far in excess of those standards this is believed to be due to a  galvanic  reaction

as of  april 5   2007  nickel was trading at 52300 us mt  5230 uskg 2351 uslb or 147 usoz       interestingly the  us nickel coin  contains 004 oz 125 g of nickel which at this new price is worth 65 cents along with 375 grams of copper worth about 3 cents making the metal value over 9 cents since a nickel is worth 5 cents this made it an attractive target for melting by people wanting to sell the metals at a profit however the  united states mint  in anticipation of this practice implemented new interim rules on  december 14   2006  subject to public comment for 30 days which criminalize the melting and export of cents and nickels   violators can be punished with a fine of up to us10000 andor imprisoned for a maximum of five years
========
at current use rates the supply of nickel is predicted to run out in 90 years

niobium    or columbium    is a  chemical element  that has the symbol nb and  atomic number  41 a rare soft gray  ductile   transition metal  niobium is found in  pyrochlore  and  columbite  it was first discovered in the latter mineral and so was initially named columbium now that mineral is also called niobite niobium is used in special  steel   alloys  as well as in  welding   nuclear industries   electronics   optics  and  jewelry
========
niobium is a shiny gray ductile  metal  that takes on a  bluish  tinge when exposed to air at room temperature for extended periods niobiums chemical properties are almost identical to the chemical properties of  tantalum  which appears below niobium in the  periodic table
========
when it is processed at even moderate temperatures niobium must be placed in a protective atmosphere the metal begins to  oxidize  in air at 200   c  its most common  oxidation states  are 3 and 5 although others are also known
========
niobium has a number of uses it is a component of some  stainless steels  and an  alloy  of other nonferrous metals it is also a very important alloy addition in  hsla steels  which are widely used as structural components in modern automobiles these alloys are strong and are often used in pipeline construction other uses
the metal has a low capture crosssection for thermal  neutrons  and so finds use in the nuclear industries
it is also the metal used in  arc welding  rods for some stabilized grades of stainless  steel
appreciable amounts of niobium in the form of highpurity ferroniobium and  nickel  niobium are used in  nickel   cobalt  and  iron base  superalloys  for such applications as  jet engine  components  rocket  subassemblies and heatresisting and combustion equipment for example advanced air frame systems such as those used in the  gemini program  used this metal
niobium is being evaluated as an alternative to  tantalum  in  capacitors
because niobium and some niobium alloys are physiologically inert and thus  hypoallergenic  they are used in  jewelry  and in medical devices such as pacemakers niobium treated with  sodium hydroxide  forms a porous layer that aids  osseointegration
along with  titanium   tantalum  and  aluminum  niobium can also be electrically heated and  anodized  to a wide array of colors using a process known as  reactive metal anodizing  this makes it very attractive for use in jewelry
niobium is also added to glass in order to attain a higher  refractive index  a property used in the optical industry to make thinner  corrective glasses
in 2005 the country of  sierra leone  made a coin honoring  pope john paul ii  that contained a disc of 24 carat 100 gold surrounded by a ring of purpletinted niobium
========
niobium becomes a  superconductor  when lowered to  cryogenic   temperatures  at atmospheric pressure it has the highest critical temperature of the elemental superconductors 93  k  niobium has the largest  magnetic penetration depth  of any element in addition it is one of the three elemental superconductors that are type ii the others being  vanadium  and  technetium  meaning it remains a superconductor when subjected to high magnetic fields niobium tin  and niobium titanium  alloys are used as wires for  superconducting magnets  capable of producing exceedingly strong  magnetic fields  niobium is also used in its pure form to make superconducting accelerating structures for  particle accelerators
========
niobium  greek mythology   niobe  daughter of  tantalus  was  discovered  by  charles hatchett  in 1801 hatchett found niobium in  columbite  ore that was sent to england in the 1750s by  john winthrop  the first governor of  connecticut  there was a considerable amount of confusion about the difference between the closelyrelated niobium and  tantalum  that wasnt resolved until 1846 by  heinrich rose  and  jean charles galissard de marignac  who rediscovered the element since rose was unaware of hatchetts work he gave the element a different name niobium in 1864  christian blomstrand  was the first to prepare the pure metal  reducing  niobium chloride by heating it in a  hydrogen  atmosphere
========
columbium symbol cb was the name originally given to this element by hatchett but the  international union of pure and applied chemistry  iupac officially adopted niobium as the name for element 41 in 1950 after 100 years of controversy this was a compromise of sorts the iupac accepted  tungsten  instead of wolfram in deference to north american usage and niobium instead of columbium in deference to european usage  not everyone agreed however and while many leading chemical societies and government organizations refer to it by the official iupac name many leading metallurgists metal societies and most leading  american  commercial producers still refer to the metal by the original  columbium
========

the element is never found as a free element but does occur in the minerals  columbite   fe  mn nb ta 2 o 6  columbitetantalite  or  coltan  femntanb2o6  pyrochlore  na ca 2nb2o6 oh  f  and  euxenite   y ca ce  u  th nbta ti 2o6  minerals  that contain niobium often also contain tantalum large deposits of niobium have been found associated with  carbonatites   carbon  silicate   igneous rocks  and as a constituent of pyrochlore  brazil  and  canada  are the major producers of niobium mineral concentrates and extensive ore reserves are also in  nigeria   democratic republic of congo  and in  russia
a large producer in brazil is cbmm located in  arax√°  minas gerais
========

naturally occurring niobium is composed of one stable  isotope  nb93 the most stable  radioisotopes  are nb92 with a  halflife  of 347 million years nb94 half life 20300 years and nb91 with a half life of 680 years there is also a  meta state  at 31  kev  whose halflife is 1613 years twenty three other radioisotopes have been characterized most of these have half lives that are less than two hours except nb95 35 days nb96 234 hours and nb90 146 hours the primary  decay mode  before the stable nb93 is  electron capture  and the primary mode after is  beta emission  with some  neutron emission  occurring in the first mode of the two mode decay of nb104 109 and 110
========
only nb95 35 days and nb97 72 minutes and heavier isotopes halflives in seconds are  fission products  in significant quantity as the other isotopes are shadowed by stable or very longlived  zr93  isotopes of the preceding element  zirconium  from production via  beta decay  of neutronrich fission fragments nb95 is the  decay product  of zr95 64 days so disappearance of nb95 in  used nuclear fuel  is slower than would be expected from its own 35 day halflife alone tiny amounts of the other isotopes may be produced as direct fission products
