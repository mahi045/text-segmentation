the common  allotrope  of elemental oxygen on earth o2 is known as dioxygen  elemental oxygen is most commonly encountered in this form as about 21 by volume of earths atmosphere o2 has a bond length of 121 pm and a bond energy of 498 kjmol
========
triatomic oxygen  ozone  o3 the less common triatomic allotrope of oxygen is a poisonous gas with a distinctive odor traces of it can be detected as a sharp chlorinelike smell coming from  electric motors   laser printers  and  photocopiers
it was named ozone by  christian friedrich schönbein  in 1840 from the greek word öįώ ozo for smell  liquid and solid o3 have a deeperblue color than ordinary oxygen and they are unstable and explosive
========
a newlydiscovered  allotrope  of oxygen  tetraoxygen  o4 is a deepred solid that is created by pressurizing o2 to the order of 20 gpa its properties are being studied for use in  rocket fuels  and similar applications as it is a much more powerful  oxidizer  than either o2 or o3
when tetraoxygen is subjected to a pressure of 96 gpa it becomes  metallic  in a similar manner as  hydrogen  and becomes more similar to the heavier chalcogens such as  tellurium  and  polonium  both of which show significant metallic character

========
in almost all known compounds of oxygen the  oxidation state  of oxygen is 2 the oxidation state 1 is found in a few compounds such as  peroxides  compounds containing oxygen in other oxidation states are very uncommon 12  superoxides  13  ozonides  0 elemental  hypofluorous acid  12  dioxygenyl  1  dioxygen difluoride  and 2  oxygen difluoride
========
the most familiar oxygen compound is  water  the oxide of hydrogen h2o oxygen as a compound is also present in the atmosphere in trace quantities in the form of  carbon dioxide  co2 however the  earths crustal   rock  is composed predominantly of oxides of  silicon  as  silica  sio2 found in  granite  and  sand   silicates  found in  feldspars  and oxygen compounds of  metals  such as  calcium  as  calcium carbonate  in  limestone   aluminium  as silicates in feldspars and as  aluminium oxide  in  bauxite  and  corundum   iron  as  iron iii oxide  fe2o3 in  hematite  and  rust  etc
========
other important examples of oxygen compounds include the compounds of carbon and oxygen such as   alcohols  roh where r is an organic group  carbonyls  rcoh or rcor such as  formaldehyde  and  acetone  and  carboxylic acids  rcooh such as  acetic acid  and  palmitic acid  a common  fatty acid  found in animals and plants and the food products derived from them such as  palm oil  and  milk  products
========
oxygenated  radicals  such as  chlorates  clo3minus perchlorates  clo4minus  chromates  cro42minus  dichromates  cr2o72minus  permanganates  mno4minus and  nitrates  no3minus are strong oxidizing agents  phosphorus  is important in its oxygenated form as the  phosphate  po43minus ion present in  bone  as  calcium phosphate  and as the backbone of  rna  and  dna
========
oxygen forms  heteropoly acids  and  polyoxometalate  ions with  tungsten   molybdenum  and some other  transition metals   phosphotungstic acid  pta or dodecatungstophosphoric acid has the chemical formula h3pw12o40 while octadecamolybdophosphoric acid is h6p2mo18o62
========
oxygen forms compounds with almost all of the other known elements including some of the rarest  technetium   tcosub4subsupminussup   promethium   chempm2o3  and  neptunium     and also with some of the least reactive elements such as  xenon   chemxeo3   gold   chemau2o3  and  platinum      synthetic elements  that have known oxides include plutonium  chempuo2   americium      curium      berkelium      californium     and  einsteinium
========
one unexpected oxygen compound is  dioxygen hexafluoroplatinate  o2ptf6minus discovered when  neil bartlett  was studying the properties of  platinum hexafluoride  ptf6 he noticed a change in color when this compound was exposed to atmospheric air and reasoned that  xenon  should be oxidized by ptf6 this led him to the discovery of  xenon hexafluoroplatinate  xeptf6minus
========
the cation o22 in o2f2 is only formed in the presence of stronger oxidants than oxygen which limits it to oxygen fluorides eg  oxygen fluoride
========
when dissolved in water many metallic oxides form  alkaline  solutions while many oxides of nonmetals form  acidic  solutions for example  sodium oxide  in solution forms the strong base  sodium hydroxide  while  phosphorus pentoxide  in solution forms  phosphoric acid
========
the  alkali metals  in groups 1 and 2 of the  periodic table    lithium   sodium   potassium   rubidium   cesium   magnesium   calcium   strontium  and  barium  all react spontaneously with oxygen when exposed to air to form oxides and form hydroxides in the presence of water none of these elements are found in nature as free metals cesium is so reactive with oxygen that it is used as a  getter  in  vacuum tubes  the surface of aluminium is always oxidised in the presence of air coated with a thin film of  aluminium oxide  that  passivates  the metal and slows further  corrosion  the aluminium oxide layer can be built to greater thickness by the process of  electrolytic   anodising  although solid magnesium and aluminium react slowly with oxygen at  stp  they are both capable of burning in air generating very high temperatures and the metal powders may form explosive mixtures with air

========
some substances need to be heated before they will react with oxygen in bulk but some such as  iron  readily forms  iron oxide  or rust fe2o3 the production of free oxygen by  photosynthetic   bacteria  some 35 billion years ago  precipitated  iron out of solution in the oceans as fe2o3 in the economicallyimportant  iron ore   hematite
========
due to its  electronegativity  oxygen forms  chemical bonds  with almost all other free elements at elevated temperatures to give corresponding  oxides  socalled noble metals common examples  gold   platinum  resist direct chemical combination with oxygen and substances like  goldiii oxide  must be formed by an indirect route
