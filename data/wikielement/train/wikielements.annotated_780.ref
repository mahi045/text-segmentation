neodymium    is a  chemical element  with the symbol nd and  atomic number  60
========
neodymium a  rare earth   metal  is present in  misch metal  to the extent of about 18 the metal has a bright silvery metallic luster however as one of the more reactive rare earth metals it quickly tarnishes in air the tarnishing forms an oxide layer that falls off which exposes the metal to further oxidation although it belongs to rare earth metals neodymium is not rare at all it constitutes 38 ppm of  earth s crust
========
 neodymium magnets  are the strongest permanent  magnets  known   ndsub2subfesub14subb  these magnets are cheaper lighter and stronger than  samariumcobalt magnets   neodymium magnets  appear in highquality products such as  microphones  professional  loudspeakers  inear  headphones   dokodemo magnets   guitar  and  bass guitar   pickups  and computer  hard disks  where low mass small volume or strong magnetic fields are required
neodymium is a component of  didymium  used for coloring glass to make  welder s and glassblowers goggles the sharp absorption bands obliterate the strong sodium emission at 589 nm
neodymium lamps are incandescent lamps containing neodymium in the glass to filter out yellow light resulting in a whiter light more like sunlight
neodymium colors  glass  in delicate shades ranging from pure violet through winered and warm grey light transmitted through such glass shows unusually sharp  absorption bands  the glass is used in  astronomical work  to produce sharp bands by which  spectral lines  may be calibrated neodymium is also used to remove the green colour caused by  iron  contaminants from glass
neodymium salts are used as a colourant for  enamels
probably because of similarities to ca2 nd3 has been reported    to promote plant growth rare earth element compounds are frequently used in china as  fertilizer
size and strength of volcanic eruption can be predicted by scanning for neodymium  isotopes  small and large volcanic eruptions produce lava with different neodymium isotope composition from the composition of isotopes scientists predict how big the coming eruption will be and use this information to warn residents of the intensity of the eruption
certain transparent materials with a small concentration of neodymium  ions  can be used in  lasers  as  gain media  for infrared wavelengths 10541064 nm eg  ndyag  yttrium aluminium garnet  ndylf  yttrium lithium fluoride  ndyvosub4sub  yttrium orthovanadate and ndglass the current laser at the uk  atomic weapons establishment  awe the helen 1tw neodymiumglass laser can access the midpoints of pressure and temperature regions and is used to acquire data for modeling on how density temperature and pressure interact inside warheads helen can create plasmas of around 106  k  from which opacity and transmission of radiation are measured
========
neodymium  glass  ndglass is produced by the inclusion of  neodymium oxide  nd2o3 in the glass melt in daylight or  incandescent  light neodymium glass appears lavender but it appears pale blue under  fluorescent  lighting
========
neodymium glass  solidstate lasers  are used in extremely high power  terawatt  scale high energy  megajoules  multiple beam systems for  inertial confinement fusion  ndglass lasers are usually  frequency tripled  to the  third harmonic  at 351 nm in laser fusion devices

neodymium glass is becoming widely used in  incandescent light bulbs  to provide a more natural light
========
neodymium glass has been patented for use in automobile rearview mirrors to reduce the glare at night
========
the first commercial use of purified neodymium was in glass coloration starting with experiments by leo moser in november 1927 the resulting alexandrite glass remains a signature color of the moser glassworks to this day  neodymium glass was widely emulated in the early 1930s by american glasshouses most notably heisey fostoria wisteria cambridge heatherbloom and steuben wisteria and elsewhere eg lalique in france or murano tiffins twilight remained in production from about 1950 to about 1980 current sources include glassmakers in the czech republic the usa and china caithness glass in scotland has also used the colorant extensively the sharp absorption bands of neodymium cause the glass color to change under different lighting conditions being reddishpurple under daylight or yellow incandescent light but blue under white fluorescent lighting or greenish under trichromatic lighting  this colorchange phenomenon is highly prized by collectors neodymium in combination with praseodymium gave mosers heliolite glass  in combination with gold or selenium beautiful red colors result such as mosers royalite or tiffins wistaria or some of the colors achieved by fenton  since neodymium coloration depends upon forbidden ff transitions deep within the atom there is relatively little influence on the color from the chemical environment so the color is impervious to the thermal history of the glass  however for the best color ironcontaining impurities need to be minimized in the silica used to make the glass the same forbiddenness of the ff transitions makes rare earth colorants less intense than those provided by most dtransition elements so more has to be used in a glass to achieve the desired color intensity  the original moser recipe used about 5 of neodymium oxide in the glass melt a sufficient quantity such that moser referred to these as being rare earth doped glasses being a strong base that level of neodymium would have affected the melting properties of the glass and the lime content of the glass might have had to be adjusted accordingly

neodymium was discovered by baron  carl auer von welsbach  an  austrian   chemist  in  vienna  in  1885  he separated neodymium as well as the element  praseodymium  from a material known as  didymium  by means of fractional crystallization of the double ammonium nitrate tetrahydrates from nitric acid while following the separation by  spectroscopic  analysis however it was not isolated in relatively pure form until  1925  the name neodymium is derived from the  greek  words neos new and didymos twin neodymium is frequently  misspelled  as neodynium
========
double nitrate crystallization was the means of commercial neodymium purification until the 1950s  the lindsay chemical division of american potash and chemical corporation at one time the largest producer of rare earths in the world offered neodymium oxide purified in this manner in grades of 65 85 and 95 purity at prices ranging from approximately 2 to 20 dollars per pound in 1960 dollars lindsay was the first to commercialize largescale ionexchange purification of neodymium using the technology developed by frank spedding at iowa state universityames laboratory one pound of their 99 oxide was priced at 35 in 1960 their 999 grade only cost 5 dollars more starting in the 1950s high purity eg 99 neodymium was primarily obtained through an  ion exchange  process from  monazite  sand celathndypo4 a material rich in rare earth elements  the metal itself is obtained through  electrolysis  of its  halide   salts   currently most neodymium is extracted from bastnaesite celandprco3f and purified by solvent extraction  ionexchange purification is reserved for preparing the highest purities typically 4n  when molycorp first introduced their 98 grade of neodymium oxide in 1965 made by solvent extraction from mountain pass california bastnaesite it was priced at 5 dollars per pound for small quantities  lindsay soon discontinued operations  the evolving technology and improved purity of commercially available neodymium oxide was reflected in the appearance of neodymium glass made therefrom that resides in collections today  early moser pieces and other neodymium glass made in the 1930s have a more reddish or orange tinge than modern versions which are more cleanly purple due to the difficulties in removing the last traces of praseodymium when the fractional crystallization technology had to be relied on
========
neodymium is never found in nature as the free element rather it occurs in ores such as  monazite  sand celathndypo4 and  bastn√§site  celathndyco3f that contain small amounts of all the rare earth metals neodymium can also be found in  misch metal  it is difficult to separate it from other rare earth elements
