osmium    is a  chemical element  that has the symbol os and  atomic number  76 osmium is a hard brittle bluegray or blueblack  transition metal  in the  platinum family  and is one of the densest natural elements competing for this status with  iridium  osmium is used in  alloys  with  platinum   iridium  and other platinum group metals osmium is found in nature as an alloy in platinum ore alloys of osmium are employed in  fountain pen  tips electrical contacts and in other applications where extreme durability and hardness are needed
========
osmium in a  metallic  form is extremely  dense  bluewhite brittle and lustrous even at high temperatures but proves to be extremely difficult to make powdered osmium is easier to make but powdered osmium exposed to air leads to the formation of  osmium tetroxide  os o 4 which is very toxic the tetroxide is a powerful  oxidizing  agent very volatile watersoluble pale yellow crystalline solid with a strong smell that boils at 130 c  by contrast osmium dioxide os o 2 is black nonvolatile and much less reactive and toxic
========
due to its very high  density  osmium is generally considered to be the densest known element narrowly defeating  iridium  however calculations of density from the  space lattice  may produce more reliable data for these elements than actual measurements and give a density of 22650  kgmsup3sup  for iridium versus 22610 kgm for osmium definitive selection between the two is therefore not possible at this time if one distinguishes different isotopes then the highest density ordinary substance would be 192os the extraordinary density of osmium is a consequence of the  lanthanide contraction
========
osmium has a very low  compressibility  correspondingly its  bulk modulus  is extremely highcommonly quoted as 462 gpa which is higher than that of  diamond  but lower than that of  aggregated diamond nanorods although there is some debate in the academic community about whether it is in fact this high a paper by cynn et al  reported that osmium had this bulk modulus based on an experimental result but other authors have cast doubt upon this  and references therein
========
osmium metal has the highest  melting point  and the lowest  vapor pressure  of the  platinum family  common  oxidation states  of osmium are 4 and 3 but oxidation states from 1 to 8 are observed
========
because of the volatility and extreme toxicity of its oxide osmium is rarely used in its pure state and is instead often  alloyed  with other metals that are used in highwear applications osmium alloys such as  osmiridium  are very hard and along with other platinum group metals is almost entirely used in alloys employed in the tips of  fountain pens   phonograph  needles instrument pivots and electrical contacts as they can resist wear from frequent use
========
osmium tetroxide has been used in  fingerprint  detection and in staining  fatty  tissue for microscope slides as a strong oxidant it crosslinks lipids mainly by reacting with unsaturated carboncarbon bonds and thereby both fixes biological membranes in place in tissue samples and simultaneously  stains  them since osmium atoms are extremely electron dense making oso4 an important stain for  transmission electron microscopy  tem studies of many biological materials an alloy of 90 platinum and 10 osmium 9010 is used in  surgical implants  such as  pacemakers  and replacement  pulmonary  valves
========
the tetroxide and a related compound potassium osmate are important oxidants for chemical synthesis despite being very poisonous
========
in 1898 an austrian chemist  auer von welsbach  developed the oslamp with a filament made of osmium which he introduced commercially in 1902 after only a few years osmium was replaced by the more stable metal  tungsten  originally known as wolfram tungsten has the highest melting point of any metal and using it in light bulbs increases the luminous efficacy and life of incandescent lamps
========
the light bulb manufacturer  osram  founded in 1906 when three german companies auergesellschaft aeg and siemens  halske combined their lamp production facilities derived its name from the elements of osmium and wolfram
========
osmium  greek  osme meaning a smell was discovered in  1803  by  smithson tennant  and  william hyde wollaston  in  london   england
========
wollaston and tennant were looking for a way to purify platinum by  dissolution  of native  platinum   ore  in  aqua regia  large amounts of insoluble black powder remained as a byproduct of this operation
========
wollaston concentrated on the soluble portion and discovered  palladium  in  1802  and  rhodium  in  1804  while tennant examined the insoluble residue in the summer of  1803  tennant identified two new elements osmium and  iridium  discovery of the new elements was documented in a letter to the  royal society  on  june 21   1804
