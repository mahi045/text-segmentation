rubidium has a number of  oxides  including rb6o and rb9o2 which appear if rubidium metal is left exposed to air the final product of reacting with oxygen is the  superoxide  rbo2 rubidium forms salts with most anions some common rubidium compounds are rubidium chloride rbcl rubidium monoxide rb2o and rubidium copper sulfate rb2so4cuso46h20 a compound of rubidium silver and iodine rbag4i5 has interesting electrical characteristics and might be useful in thin film batteries
========
rubidium reacts violently with water and can cause fires to ensure both health and safety and purity this element must be kept under a dry  mineral oil  in a  vacuum  or in an inert  atmosphere
========
rubidium like sodium and potassium is almost always in its 1 oxidation state the human body tends to treat rb ions as if they were potassium ions and therefore concentrates rubidium in the bodys electrolytic fluid the ions are not particularly toxic and are relatively quickly removed in the sweat and urine however taken in excess it can be dangerous

ruthenium    is a  chemical element  that has the symbol ru and  atomic number  44 a rare  transition metal  of the  platinum group  of the  periodic table  ruthenium is found associated with  platinum  ores and used as a  catalyst  in some platinum  alloys
========
a polyvalent hard white metal ruthenium is a member of the  platinum group  has four crystal modifications and does not tarnish at normal temperatures but does  oxidize  readily on exposure to air to form  ruthenium tetroxide  ruo4 a strong oxidising agent with properties analogous to those of  osmium tetroxide  ruthenium dissolves in fused alkalis is not attacked by acids but is attacked by  halogens  at high temperatures  small amounts of ruthenium can increase the hardness of  platinum  and  palladium  the  corrosion  resistance of  titanium  is increased markedly by the addition of a small amount of ruthenium
========
this metal can be plated either through  electrodeposition  or by thermal decomposition methods  one  ruthenium molybdenum   alloy  has been found to be  superconductive  at 106  k  the  oxidation states  of ruthenium range from 1 to 8 and 2 is known though oxidation states of 2 3 and 4 are most common
========
due to its ability to harden platinum and palladium ruthenium is used in platinum and palladium  alloys  to make wearresistant  electrical contacts  it is sometimes alloyed with gold in  jewelry  01 ruthenium is added to  titanium  to improve its corrosion resistance a hundredfold
========
ruthenium is also used in some advanced hightemperature singlecrystal  superalloys  with applications including the turbine blades in  jet engines
========
 fountain pen  nibs are frequently tipped with alloys containing ruthenium from 1944 onward the famous  parker 51  fountain pen was fitted with the ru nib a 14k gold nib tipped with 962 ruthenium and 38 iridium
========
ruthenium is also a versatile catalyst  hydrogen sulfide  can be split by light by using an aqueous suspension of  cd  s  particles loaded with ruthenium dioxide this may be useful in the removal of  h 2s from  oil refineries  and from other industrial processes
========
ruthenium is a component of mixedmetal oxide mmo anodes used for cathodic protection of underground and submerged structures and for electrolytic cells for chemical processes such as generating chlorine from saltwater
========
 organometallic  ruthenium  carbene  and  allenylidene  complexes have recently been found as highly efficient catalysts for  olefin metathesis  with important applications in organic and pharmaceutical chemistry
