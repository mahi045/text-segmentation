pure germanium is known to spontaneously extrude very long  screw dislocations  referred to as germanium whiskers the growth of these whiskers is one of the primary reasons for the failure of older diodes and transistors made from germanium as depending on what they end up touching they may lead to an electrical short

gadolinium    is a  chemical element  that has the symbol gd and  atomic number  64
========


========

========
gadolinium is a silverywhite  malleable  and  ductile   rareearth  metal with a metallic luster it crystallizes in  hexagonal  closepacked alpha form at room temperature but when heated to 1508  k  or more it transforms into its beta form which has a  bodycentered cubic  structure
========
unlike other rare earth elements gadolinium is relatively stable in dry air however it tarnishes quickly in moist air and forms a looselyadhering  oxide  that  spalls  off and then exposes more surface to oxidation gadolinium reacts slowly with water and it is soluble in dilute acids
========
gadolinium157 has the highest  thermal neutron   capture  crosssection of any known nuclide with the exception of  xenon135  49000  barns  but it also has a fast burnout rate limiting its usefulness as a  nuclear control rod  material
========
gadolinium becomes  superconductive  below a critical temperature of 1083 k it is strongly  paramagnetic  at room temperature and exhibits  ferromagnetic  properties below room temperature
========
gadolinium demonstrates a  magnetocaloric effect  whereby its temperature increases when it enters a magnetic field and decreases when it leaves the magnetic field the effect is considerably stronger for the gadolinium  alloy   gd 5 si 2 ge 2

========
gadolinium is used for making  gadolinium yttrium garnets  which have  microwave  applications and gadolinium compounds are used for making  phosphors  for colour  tv  tubes gadolinium is also used for manufacturing  compact discs  and  computer memory
========
gadolinium is used in  nuclear marine propulsion  systems as a  burnable poison   the gadolinium slows the initial reaction rate but as it decays other  neutron poisons  accumulate allowing for longrunning cores gadolinium is also used as a secondary emergency shutdown measure in some nuclear reactors particularly of the  candu  type
========
gadolinium also possesses unusual  metallurgic  properties with as little as 1 of gadolinium improving the workability and resistance of  iron   chromium  and related  alloys  to high temperatures and  oxidation
========
because of their  paramagnetic  properties solutions of  organic  gadolinium  complexes  and gadolinium compounds are used as  intravenous   radiocontrast  agents to enhance images in medical  magnetic resonance imaging   magnevist  is the most widespread example
========
besides  mri  gadolinium gd is also used in other imaging in  xray  gadolinium is contained in the phosphor layer suspending in a polymer matrix at the detector  terbium  doped   gadolinium oxysulfide  gd2o2s tb at the phosphor layer is to convert the xrays releasing from the source into light gd can emit at 540nm green light  spectrum   520  570nm which is very useful for enhancing the imaging quality of the  xray  that is exposed to the photographic film beside gds spectrum range the compound also has a kedge at 50 kiloelectron volt kev which means its absorption of  xray  through  photoelectric  interactions is great the energy conversion of gd is up to 20 which means onefifth of the xray striking on the phosphor layer can be converted into light photons
