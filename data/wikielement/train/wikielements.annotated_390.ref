holmium    is a  chemical element  with the symbol ho and  atomic number  67 part of the  lanthanide series  holmium is a relatively soft and malleable silverywhite  metallic  element which is stable in dry air at room temperature  a  rare earth  metal it is found in the minerals  monazite  and  gadolinite
========
a trivalent metallic rare earth element holmium has the highest  magnetic moment  106Âµb of any naturallyoccurring element and possesses other unusual magnetic properties when combined with  yttrium  it forms highly  magnetic  compounds
========
holmium is a relatively soft and malleable element that is fairly  corrosion resistant and stable in dry air at  standard temperature and pressure  in moist air and at higher  temperatures  however it quickly  oxidizes  forming a yellowish oxide in pure form holmium possesses a metallic bright silvery luster
holmium oxide has some fairly dramatic color changes depending on the lighting conditions in daylight it is a tannish yellow color under trichromatic light it is a fiery orange red almost indistinguishable from the way erbium oxide looks under this same lighting this has to do with the sharp emission bands of the phosphors and the absorption bands of both oxides
========
because of its magnetic properties holmium has been used to create the strongest artificiallygenerated  magnetic fields  when placed within highstrength  magnets  as a  magnetic pole  piece also called a  magnetic flux concentrator  since it can absorb  nuclear fission bred neutrons the element is also used in  nuclear control rods  other commercial applications of the element include
========
its very high magnetic moment is suitable for use in yttrium iron  garnet  yig and yttrium lanthanum  fluoride  ylf  solid state lasers  found in  microwave  equipment which are in turn found in a variety of medical and dental settings
========
holmium oxide is used as a yellow or red  glass  coloring
holmium containing glass has been used as a calibration standard for uvvisible spectrophotometers
holmium is one of the colorants used for  cubic zirconia  for use in jewelry providing a dichromic color in peach or yellow depending on the lighting source
holmium is used in a laser to break up  kidney stones  while being minimally invasive
========
few other uses have been identified for this element
========
holmium holmia  latin  name for  stockholm  was  discovered  by  marc delafontaine  and  jacqueslouis soret  in  1878  who noticed the  aberrant  spectrographic   absorption bands  of the thenunknown element they called it element x later in 1878  per teodor cleve  independently discovered the element while he was working on  erbia  earth  erbium oxide
========
using the method developed by  carl gustaf mosander  cleve first removed all of the known contaminants from erbia the result of that effort was two new materials one brown and one green he named the brown substance holmia after the latin name for cleves home town stockholm and the green one thulia holmia was later found to be the  holmium oxide  and thulia was  thulium oxide
========
like all other rare earths holmium is not naturally found as a free element it does occur combined with other elements in the minerals  gadolinite   monazite  and  in other rareearth  minerals  it is commercially extracted via  ionexchange  from monazite sand 005 holmium but is still difficult to separate from other rare earths the element has been isolated through the  reduction  of its anhydrous  chloride  or  fluoride  with metallic  calcium  its estimated abundance in the  earth s crust is 13 milligrams per kilogram holmium obeys the  oddoharkins rule  as an oddnumbered element it is less abundant than its immediate even numbered neighbors dysprosium and erbium however it is the most abundant of the oddnumbered heavy lanthanides  the principal current source are some of the ionadsorption clays of southern china  some of these have a rare earth composition similar to that found in xenotime or gadolinite  yttrium makes up about twothirds of the total by weight holmium is around 15  the original ores themselves are very lean maybe only 01 total lanthanide but are easily extracted
========

 natural  holmium contains one  stable   isotope  holmium 165 some synthetic radioactive isotopes are known the most stable one is holmium 163 with a half life of 4570 years all other radioisotopes have half lives not greater than 1117 days and most have half lives under 3 hours
========
the element as with other rare earths appears to have a low acute  toxic  rating holmium plays no biological role in  humans  but may be able to stimulate   metabolism
