silver    is a  chemical element  with the symbol ag    and atomic number 47 a soft white lustrous  transition metal  it has the highest electrical conductivity of any element and the highest thermal conductivity of any metal it occurs as a free metal native silver as well as in various  minerals  such as  argentite  and  chlorargyrite  most silver is produced as a byproduct of  copper   gold   lead  and  zinc  mining
========
silver has been known since antiquity and it is used as a currency metal it has long been valued as a  precious metal  used in ornaments and jewellery and in highvalue tableware and utensils hence the term  silverware  today it is used in  photographic film  electrical contacts and conductors and mirrors elemental silver is also used to  catalyze  chemical reactions silver is antimicrobial and dilute solutions of  silver nitrate  and other silver compounds are used as  disinfectants  although silver has largely been supplanted by other treatments the  antiseptic  properties of silver are still a useful tool in the prevention and treatment of  sepsis  and  infections  caused by  antibiotic  resistant   microorganisms  such as  mrsa

silver is found in native form combined with  sulfur   arsenic   antimony  or  chlorine  and in various ores such as  argentite  ag2s  horn silver  agcl and  pyrargyrite  ag3sbs3 the principal sources of silver are the ores of copper coppernickel gold lead and leadzinc obtained from  peru   mexico   china  and  australia  peru and mexico have been mining silver since 1546 and are still major world producers
========
the metal can also be produced during the  electrolytic  refining of copper and by application of the  parkes process  on lead metal obtained from lead ores that contain small amounts of silver commercialgrade fine silver is at least 999 pure silver and purities greater than 99999 are available in 2005  peru  was the top producer of silver with almost oneseventh world share closely followed by mexico according to the  british geological survey

silver is a very  ductile  and  malleable  slightly harder than  gold  monovalent  coinage metal  with a brilliant white metallic luster that can take a high degree of  polish  it has the highest  electrical conductivity  of all  metals  even higher than copper but its greater cost and  tarnishability  have prevented it from being widely used in place of copper for electrical purposes though it was used in the  electromagnets  used for enriching  uranium  during  world war ii  mainly because of the wartime shortage of copper another notable exception is in  highend audio cables  although the actual benefits of its use in this application are questionable
========
among metals pure silver has the highest  thermal conductivity  only the nonmetal  diamond s is higher whitest color the highest optical  reflectivity  although  aluminium  slightly outdoes it in parts of the visible spectrum and it is a poor reflector of  ultraviolet  light silver also has the lowest  contact resistance  of any metal  silver halides  are  photosensitive  and are remarkable for their ability to record a  latent image  that can later be  developed  chemically silver is stable in pure air and water but  tarnishes  when it is exposed to air or water containing  ozone  or  hydrogen sulfide  the most common  oxidation state  of silver is 1 for example  silver nitrate  agno3 a few 2 for example  silverii fluoride  agf2 and 3 compounds for example potassium tetrafluoroargentate k agf4  are also known

naturally occurring silver is composed of the two stable  isotopes  107ag and 109ag with 107ag being the more abundant 51839  natural abundance  silvers standard atomic mass is 10786822 u
twentyeight  radioisotopes  have been characterised the most stable being 105ag with a  halflife  of 4129 days 111ag with a halflife of 745 days and 112ag with a halflife of 313 hours
========
all of the remaining  radioactive  isotopes have halflives that are less than an hour and the majority of these have halflives that are less than 3 minutes this element has numerous  meta states  the most stable being 108mag t  418 years 110mag t  24979 days and 106mag t  828 days
========
isotopes of silver range in  atomic weight  from 93943  u  94ag to 123929 u 124ag the primary  decay mode  before the most abundant stable isotope 107ag is  electron capture  and the primary mode after is  beta decay  the primary  decay products  before 107ag are  palladium  element 46 isotopes and the primary products after are  cadmium  element 48 isotopes
========
the palladium  isotope  107pd decays by beta emission to 107ag with a halflife of 65 million years  iron   meteorites  are the only objects with a highenough palladiumtosilver ratio to yield measurable variations in 107ag abundance  radiogenic  107ag was first discovered in the  santa clara  meteorite in 1978 the discoverers suggest that the coalescence and differentiation of ironcored small  planets  may have occurred 10 million years after a  nucleosynthetic  event 107pd107ag correlations observed in bodies that have clearly been melted since the  accretion  of the  solar system  must reflect the presence of live shortlived nuclides in the early solar system
