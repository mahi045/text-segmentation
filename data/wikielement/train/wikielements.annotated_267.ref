elemental fluorine is prepared industrially by  moissan s original process electrolysis of anhydrous hf in which khf2 has been dissolved to provide enough ions for conduction to take place
========
in 1986 when preparing for a conference to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the discovery of fluorine  karl christe  discovered a purely chemical preparation by reacting together at 150 c solutions in anhydrous hf of k2mnf6 and of  sbfsub5sub  the reaction is
    f6  2  f5  2    f6    f3  frac12f2
this is not a practical synthesis but demonstrates that electrolysis is not essential
========

both elemental fluorine and fluoride ions are highly toxic and must be handled with great care and any contact with  skin  and  eyes  should be strictly avoided  when it is a free element fluorine has a characteristic pungent odor that is detectable in concentrations as low as 20 nll all equipment must be  passivated  before exposure to fluorine
========
contact of exposed skin with  hydrofluoric acid  solutions poses one of the most extreme and insidious industrial threatsone which is exacerbated by the fact that hydrofluoric acid damages nerves in such a way as to make such burns initially painless the hydrofluoric acid molecule is capable of  rapidly migrating through lipid layers of cells which would ordinarily stop an ionized acid and the burns are typically deep hf may react with calcium permanently damaging the bone more seriously reaction with the bodys calcium can cause cardiac arrhythmias followed by cardiac arrest brought on by sudden chemical changes within the body these cannot always be prevented with local or intravenous injection of calcium salts hydrofluoric acid spills over just 25 of the bodys surface area about 75 in2 or 5 dm2 despite copious immediate washing have been fatal if the patient survives hydrofluoric acid burns typically produce open wounds of an especially slowhealing nature
========
elemental fluorine is a powerful oxidizer which can cause organic material combustibles or other flammable materials to ignite
========
fluorocarbons are generally inert and nontoxic the electronegativity of fluorine means that a nearby fluorine atom makes a carboxylic acid group very much more reactive  for example  trifluoroacetic acid  is 100000 times stronger than  acetic acid

francium    formerly known  as  ekacaesium  and  actinium k  is a  chemical element  that has the symbol fr and  atomic number  87 it has the lowest known  electronegativity  of all known elements and is the  second rarest  naturally occurring element after  astatine  francium is a highly  radioactive  metal that decays into astatine  radium  and  radon  as an  alkali metal  it has one  valence electron
========
francium was discovered by  marguerite perey  in  france  from which the element takes its name in 1939 it was the last element discovered in  nature  rather than synthesized  outside the laboratory francium is extremely rare with trace amounts found in  uranium  and  thorium  ores where the  isotope  francium223 continually forms and decays as little as 30nbspg one ounce exists at any given time throughout the  earth s  crust  the other isotopes are entirely synthetic  the largest amount ever collected of any isotope was a cluster of 10000 atoms of francium210 created as an  ultracold  gas at  stony brook  in 1997
========
francium is less stable than any other element lighter than  nobelium  element 102
========
francium is an  alkali metal  whose chemical properties most resemble those of  caesium  it has the highest  equivalent weight  of any element  caesium  has the secondlowest at 079 liquid francium  if such a substance were to be created  should have a  surface tension  of 005092nbsp n  m  at its melting point
francium  coprecipitates  with several caesium  salts  such as  caesium perchlorate  which results in small amounts of francium perchlorate this coprecipitation can be used to isolate francium by adapting the radiocaesium coprecipitation method of  glendenin  and  nelson  it will additionally coprecipitate with many other caesium salts including the  iodate  the  picrate  the  tartrate  also  rubidium  tartrate the  chloroplatinate  and the  silicotungstate  it also coprecipitates with  silicotungstic acid  and with  perchloric acid  without another alkali metal as a  carrier  which provides other methods of separation  nearly all francium salts are  watersoluble
========
due to its instability and rarity
========
franciums ability to be synthesized trapped and cooled along with its relatively simple  atomic structure  have made it the subject of specialized  spectroscopy  experiments these experiments have led to more specific information regarding  energy levels  and the  coupling constants  between  subatomic particles  studies on the light emitted by lasertrapped francium210 ions have provided accurate data on transitions between atomic energy levels which are fairly similar to those predicted by  quantum theory
