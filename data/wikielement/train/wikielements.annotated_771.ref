molecular nitrogen n2 in the atmosphere is relatively nonreactive due to its strong bond and n2 plays an inert role in the human body being neither produced or destroyed in nature nitrogen is converted into biologically and industrially useful compounds by some living organisms notably certain  bacteria  ie  nitrogen fixing bacteria   see  biological role  above molecular nitrogen is also released into the atmosphere in the process of decay in dead plant and animal tissues the ability to combine or fix molecular nitrogen is a key feature of modern industrial chemistry where nitrogen and  natural gas  are converted into  ammonia  via the  haber process  ammonia in turn can be used directly primarily as a  fertilizer  and in the synthesis of nitrated fertilizers or as a precursor of many other important materials including  explosives  largely via the production of  nitric acid  by the  ostwald process
