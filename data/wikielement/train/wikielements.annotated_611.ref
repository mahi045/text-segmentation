mendelevium    also known as unnilunium    symbol unu is a  synthetic element  with the symbol md formerly mv and the  atomic number  101 a  metallic   radioactive   transuranic  element of the  actinides  mendelevium is synthesized by bombarding  einsteinium  with  alpha particles  and was named after  dmitri mendeleev
========
researchers have shown that mendelevium has a moderately stable dipositive ii  oxidation state  in addition to the more characteristic for actinide elements tripositive iii oxidation state 256md has been used to find out  some of the chemical properties of this element while in an  aqueous  solution there are no other uses of mendelevium and only trace amounts of the element have ever been produced
========
mendelevium for  dmitri mendeleev  surname commonly spelt as mendeleev mendel√©ef or even mendelejeff and first name sometimes spelt as dmitry or dmitriy was first  synthesized  by  albert ghiorso  team leader  glenn t seaborg   bernard harvey   greg choppin  and  stanley g thompson  in early  1955  at the university of california berkeley the team produced 256md  halflife  of 76 minutes when they bombarded an 253 es  target with  alpha particles   helium  nuclei in the  berkeley radiation laboratory s 60inch  cyclotron  256md was the first element to be synthesized oneatomatatime element 101 was the ninth  transuranic element  synthesized  it is used for things such as creating the rubber in tires
