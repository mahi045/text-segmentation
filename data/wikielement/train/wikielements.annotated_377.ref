apart from its use as a reactant h2 has wide applications in physics and engineering it is used as a  shielding gas  in  welding  methods such as  atomic hydrogen welding  h2 is used as the rotor coolant in  electrical generators  at  power stations  because it has the highest  thermal conductivity  of any gas liquid h2 is used in  cryogenic  research including  superconductivity  studies since h2 is  lighter than air  having a little more than 115th of the density of air it was once widely used as a lifting agent in  balloons  and  airships  however this use was curtailed after the  hindenburg disaster  erroneously convinced the public that the gas was too dangerous for this purpose hydrogen is still regularly used for the inflation of  weather balloons
