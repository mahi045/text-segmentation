although the system for maintaining optimal salt and water balance in the body is a complex one one of the primary ways in which the human body keeps track of loss of body water is that  osmoreceptors  in the  hypothalamus  sense a balance of sodium and water concentration in extracellular fluids relative loss of body water will cause sodium concentration to rise higher than normal a condition known as  hypernatremia  this ordinarily results in thirst conversely an excess of body water caused by drinking will result in too little sodium in the blood  hyponatremia  a condition which is again sensed by the  hypothalamus  causing a decrease in  vasopressin  hormone secretion from the  posterior pituitary  and a consequent loss of water in the urine which acts to restore blood sodium concentrations to normal
