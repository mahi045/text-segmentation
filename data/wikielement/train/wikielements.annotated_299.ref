gallium    is a  chemical element  that has the symbol ga and  atomic number  31 a soft silvery metallic  poor metal  gallium is a brittle solid at low temperatures but liquefies slightly above  room temperature  and will melt in the hand it occurs in trace amounts in  bauxite  and  zinc  ores an important application is in the compounds  gallium nitride  and  gallium arsenide  used as a  semiconductor  most notably in  lightemitting diodes  leds
========
elemental gallium is not found in nature but it is easily obtained by  smelting
very pure gallium metal has a brilliant silvery color and its solid metal fractures  conchoidally  like  glass  gallium metal expands by 31 percent when it solidifies and therefore storage in either glass or metal containers is avoided due to the possibility of container rupture with freezing gallium shares the higherdensity liquid state with only a few materials like  germanium   bismuth   antimony  and  water
