hafnium is estimated to make up about 000058 of the  earth s upper  crust  by weight it is found combined in natural  zirconium  compounds but it does not exist as a free element in nature  minerals  that contain zirconium such as alvite  hf  th   zr  si  o 4  hsub2subo    thortveitite  and  zircon  zrsio4 usually contain between 1 and 5 hafnium hafnium and zirconium have nearly identical chemistry which makes the two difficult to separate about half of all hafnium metal manufactured is produced as a byproduct of zirconium refinement this is done through reducing  hafniumiv chloride  with  magnesium  or  sodium  in the  kroll process

========
a major source of zircon and hence hafnium ores are  heavy mineral sands ore deposits   pegmatites  particularly in  brazil  and  malawi  and  carbonatite  intrusions particularly the crown polymetallic deposit at mount weld western australia a potential source of hafnium is trachyte tuffs containing rare zirconhafnium silicates  eudialyte  or  armostrongite  at  dubbo  in new south wales australia
========
care needs to be taken when machining hafnium because like its sister metal zirconium when hafnium is divided into fine particles it is  pyrophoric  and can ignite spontaneously in air see  dragons breath  for a demonstration compounds that contain this metal are rarely encountered by most people the pure metal is not considered toxic but hafnium compounds should be handled as if they are toxic because the ionic forms of metals are normally at greatest risk for toxicity and limited animal testing has been done for hafnium compounds

hassium    is a  synthetic element  in the  periodic table  that has the symbol hs and  atomic number  108 hassium oxidizes similar to osmium above it to a hassium tetroxide with a lower volatility than  osmium tetroxide
========
hassium was  first synthesized  in  1984  by a german research team led by  peter armbruster  and  gottfried münzenberg  at the  institute for heavy ion research  gesellschaft für schwerionenforschung in  darmstadt  the name hassium was proposed by them derived from the  latin  name for the german state of  hessen  where the institute is located
========
there was an  element naming controversy  as to what the elements from 101 to 109 were to be called thus  iupac  adopted unniloctium    symbol uno as a temporary  element name  for this element in  1994  a committee of iupac recommended that element 108 be named hahnium  the name hassium was adopted internationally in  1997
========
 isotope  270 of hassium discovered by an international team of scientists led by the  technical university of munich  in december 2006 is a  doubly magic  isotope with an unusually long  halflife  of 22 seconds the existence of such relatively stable heavy isotopes had already been theoretically predicted with some theories suggesting hassium270 may form part of an  island of stability
