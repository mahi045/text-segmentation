the primary  decay mode  before the only stable isotope 103rh is  electron capture  and the primary mode after is  beta emission  the primary  decay product  before 103rh is  ruthenium  and the primary product after is  palladium

rhodium metal is as a  noble metal  inert
========
however when rhodium is chemically bound it is reactive rhodium compounds are not often encountered by most people and should be considered to be highly  toxic  and  carcinogenic    lethal intake ld50 for rats is 126 mgkg of rhodium chloride rhcl3   rhodium compounds can stain human skin very strongly the element plays no biological role in humans however if used plainly without compounds the metal is harmless
========
rhodium has been used for honours or to symbolize wealth when more commonly used metals such as silver gold or platinum are deemed insufficient  in 1979 the  guinness book of world records  gave  paul mccartney  a rhodiumplated disc for being historys alltime bestselling songwriter and recording artist  guinness has also noted items such as the worlds most expensive pen or most expensive board game as containing rhodium

radium    is a radioactive  chemical element  which has the symbol ra and  atomic number  88 its appearance is almost pure white but it readily  oxidizes  on exposure to air turning black radium is an  alkaline earth metal  that is found in trace amounts in  uranium  ores it is extremely  radioactive  its most stable  isotope  226ra has a  halflife  of 1602 years and decays into  radon  gas
========
the heaviest of the  alkaline earth metals  radium is intensely radioactive and resembles  barium  in its chemical behavior this metal is found in tiny quantities in the uranium ore  pitchblende  and various other uranium  minerals  radium preparations are remarkable for maintaining themselves at a higher  temperature  than their surroundings and for their radiations which are of three kinds  alpha particles   beta particles  and  gamma rays  radium also produces  neutrons  when mixed with  beryllium
========
when freshly prepared pure radium metal is brilliant white but blackens when exposed to air probably due to  nitride  formation radium is  luminescent  giving a faint blue color reacts violently with  water  and  oil  to form  radium hydroxide  and is slightly more volatile than  barium  the normal phase of radium is a solid
========
some of the few practical uses of radium are derived from its radioactive properties more recently discovered  radioisotopes  such as  sup60supco  and  sup137supcs  are replacing radium in even these limited uses because several of these isotopes are more powerful emitters safer to handle and available in more concentrated form
========
when mixed with  beryllium  it is a  neutron source  for  physics  experiments

radium was formerly used in  selfluminous  paints for watches nuclear panels aircraft switches clocks and instrument dials more than 100 former  watch dial painters  who used their lips to shape the paintbrush died from the radiation soon afterward the adverse effects of radioactivity became widely known radium was still used in dials as late as the 1950s although  tritiums   beta radiation  is potentially dangerous if ingested it has replaced radium in these applications
========
during the 1930s it was found that workers exposure to radium by handling  luminescent  paints caused serious health effects which included sores  anemia  and  bone cancer  this use of radium was stopped soon afterward  this is because radium is treated as  calcium  by the body and deposited in the bones where radioactivity degrades  marrow  and can mutate bone cells the litigation and ultimate deaths of five  radium girl  employees who had used radiumbased  luminous paints  on the dials of watches and clocks had a significant impact on the formulation of  occupational disease   labor law
========
radium was also put in some foods for taste and as a preservative but also exposed many people to radiation radium was once an additive in products like toothpaste hair creams and even food items due to its supposed curative powers such products soon fell out of vogue and were prohibited by authorities in many countries after it was discovered they could have serious adverse health effects see for instance  radithor   spas  featuring radiumrich water are still occasionally touted as beneficial such as those in  misasa tottori   japan
