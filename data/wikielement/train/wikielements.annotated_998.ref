world production of scandium is in the order of 2000 kg per year generally as a byproduct of uranium and nickelcobaltcopper or pge mining consumption is in the order of 5000 kg and typically is consumed in bicycle frames in scal alloys
========
the present main source of scandium metal to meet this shortfall is from the military stockpiles of the former soviet union mainly in the country of  ukraine  which were extracted from uranium tailings there is no primary production in the americas europe or australia although gigantic scandium deposits are associated with uranium  nickel  copper  cobalt   laterite  deposits and associated with ultramafic rocks worldwide
========
scandium can also be extracted from tantalum residues tungsten processing wastes tin slags and a variety of other such industrial waste streams and it is sometimes  recovered from rare earth ores particularly the rare earth oxide deposits of bayan obo china
========
the strength and commerciality of the scandium market is yet to be demonstrated as it is a specialty metal and a single producer could corner the supply with minimal tonnage production the price in 2006 of 990 scandium oxide is of order of us700 per kilogram
========
the most common  oxidation state  of scandium in  is 3 scandium chemically resembles yttrium and the rare earth metals more than it resembles  aluminium  or  titanium  thus scandium is sometimes seen as the scandium oxide sc2o3 and as scandium chloride sccl3
========

naturally occurring scandium is composed of 1 stable  isotope  45sc 13  radioisotopes  have been characterized with the most stable being 46sc with a  halflife  of 838 days 47sc with a halflife of 335 days and 48sc with a halflife of 437 hours all of the remaining  radioactive  isotopes have half lives that are less than 4 hours and the majority of these have halflives that are less than 2 minutes this element also has 5  meta states  with the most stable being 44msc t 586 h
========
the isotopes of scandium range in  atomic weight  from 40  u  40sc to 54 u 54sc the primary  decay mode  at masses lower than the only stable isotope 45sc is  electron capture  and the primary mode at masses above it is  beta emission  the primary  decay products  at atomic weights below 45sc are  calcium  isotopes and the primary products from higher atomic weights are  titanium  isotopes

selenium    is a  chemical element  with  atomic number  34 with the chemical  symbol se it is a  nonmetal  chemically related to  sulfur  and  tellurium  and rarely occurring in its elemental state in nature it is toxic in large amounts but trace amounts of it are necessary for cellular function in most if not all animals forming the active center of the enzymes  glutathione peroxidase  and  thioredoxin reductase  which indirectly reduce certain oxidized molecules in animals and some plants and three known  deiodinase  enzymes which convert one  thyroid hormone  to another selenium requirements in plants differ by species with some plants apparently requiring none
========
isolated selenium occurs in several different forms the most stable of which is a dense purplishgray semimetal semiconductor form that is structurally a trigonal polymer chain it conducts  electricity  better in the light than in the dark and is used in  photocells  see allotropic section below selenium also exists in many nonconductive forms a black glasslike allotrope as well as several red crystalline forms built of eightmembered  ring  molecules like its lighter chemical cousin sulfur
========
selenium is found in economic quantities in  sulfide  ores such as  pyrite  partially replacing the  sulfur  in the ore matrix minerals that are selenide or selenate compounds are also known but all are rare
========
selenium occurs naturally in a number of inorganic forms including  selenide   selenate  and  selenite  in soils selenium most often occurs in soluble forms like selenate analogous to sulfate which are leached into rivers very easily by runoff
