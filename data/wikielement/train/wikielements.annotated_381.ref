throughout the universe helium is found mostly in a  plasma  state whose properties are quite different from atomic helium in a plasma heliums electrons and protons are not bound together resulting in very high electrical conductivity even when the gas is only partially ionized the charged particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric fields for example in the  solar wind  together with ionized hydrogen they interact with the earths  magnetosphere  giving rise to  birkeland currents  and the  aurora
