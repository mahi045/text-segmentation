bohrium    also called  eka  rhenium  is a  chemical element  in the  periodic table  that has the symbol bh and  atomic number  107 it is a  synthetic element  whose most stable  isotope  bh267 has a  halflife  of 22  seconds
========
although chemistry is difficult when halflives are measured in seconds  chromatography  techniques were able to provide some data that bohrium behaves like a member of group 7 of the periodic table
========
it was  synthesized  in  1976  by  soviet scientists  at the joint institute for nuclear research at  dubna  who produced isotope 261bh with a halflife of 12 ms later data gave a half life of around 10 ms  they did this by bombarding  bismuth 204 with heavy nuclei of  chromium 54
========
in  1981  a  german  research team led by  peter armbruster  and  gottfried münzenberg  at the  gesellschaft für schwerionenforschung  institute for heavy ion research in darmstadt were also able to confirm the soviet teams results and produce bohrium this time the longerlived bh262
========
the germans suggested the name nielsbohrium with symbol ns to honor the danish physicist  niels bohr  the soviets had suggested this name be given to element 105  dubnium
========
there was an  element naming controversy  as to what the elements from 101 to 109 were to be called thus  iupac  adopted unnilseptium    symbol uns as a temporary  systematic element name  for this element in  1994  a committee of iupac recommended that element 107 be named bohrium
while this conforms to the names of other elements honoring individuals where only the surname is taken it was opposed by many who were concerned that it could be confused with  boron  despite this the name bohrium for element 107 was recognized internationally in  1997

carbon    is a  chemical element  with the  symbol  c and  atomic number  6 it is a  group 14   nonmetallic   tetravalent  element that presents several  allotropic forms  of which the best known ones are  graphite  the  thermodynamically stable  form under  normal conditions   diamond  and  amorphous carbon  there are three naturallyoccurring  isotopes   sup12supc   and  sup13supc  are stable and  sup14supc  is  radioactive  decaying by 0158 mev  βsupsup emission  with a  halflife  of about 5700 years carbon is one of the  few elements known to man since antiquity  the name carbon comes from  latin language  carbo  coal  and in some  romance languages  the word carbon can refer both to the element and to coal
========
it is the  4th most abundant element in the universe by mass  after  hydrogen   helium  and  oxygen  it is ubiquitous in all known  lifeforms  and in the human body it is the second most abundant element by mass about 185 after oxygen this abundance together with the unique diversity of  organic compounds  and their unusual polymerforming ability at the temperatures commonly encountered on  earth  make this element the chemical basis of all known  life
========
the  physical properties  of carbon vary widely with the allotropic form for example diamond is highly  transparent  while graphite is  opaque  and black diamond is among the hardest materials known while graphite is soft enough to form a streak on paper diamond has a very low  electric conductivity  while graphite is a very good  conductor  also diamond has the highest  thermal conductivity  of  all known materials  all the allotropic forms are solids under  normal conditions
========
all forms of carbon are highly stable requiring high temperature to react even with oxygen the most common  oxidation state  of carbon in  inorganic compounds  is 4 while 2 is found in  carbon monoxide  and other  transition metal   carbonyl  complexes the largest sources of inorganic carbon are  limestones   dolomites  and  carbon dioxide  but significant quantities occur in organic deposits of  coal   peat   oil  and  methane clathrates  it forms more  compounds  than any other element almost ten million known
