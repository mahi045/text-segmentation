bismuth is a brittle  metal  with a  pinkish   hue  often occurring in its native form with an  iridescent   oxide  tarnish showing many  refractive  colors from yellow to blue when  combusted  with  oxygen  bismuth burns with a  blue   flame  and  its oxide  forms  yellow   fumes  its  toxicity  is much lower than that of its neighbors in the  periodic table  such as  lead   thallium  and  antimony
========
no other  metal  is more naturally  diamagnetic  as opposed to  superdiamagnetic  than bismuth and it has a high  electrical resistance  of any metal it has the second lowest  thermal conductivity  and the highest  hall coefficient  when deposited in sufficiently thin layers on a substrate bismuth is a  semiconductor  rather than a  poor metal
========
elemental bismuth is one of very few substances of which the  liquid  phase is  denser  than its  solid  phase  water  being the bestknown example because bismuth expands on  freezing  it was long an important component of lowmelting  typesetting   alloys  which needed to expand to fill printing molds
========
while bismuth was traditionally regarded as the element with the heaviest stable  isotope  it had long been suspected to be unstable on theoretical grounds this was finally demonstrated in 2003 when researchers at the  institut dastrophysique spatiale  in  orsay   france  measured the  alpha emission   halflife  of  sup209supbi  to be  19 x 10sup19sup years  over a  billion  times longer than the current estimated  age of the universe  owing to its extraordinarily long halflife for nearly all applications bismuth can be treated as if it is stable and nonradioactive the radioactivity is of academic interest however because bismuth is one of few elements whose radioactivity was suspected and indeed theoretically predicted before being detected in the laboratory
========
bismuth  new latin  bisemutum from  german  wismuth perhaps from weiße masse white mass was confused in early times with  tin  and  lead  because of its resemblance to those elements  basilius valentinus  described some of its uses in 1450   claude françois geoffroy  showed in 1753 that this metal is distinct from lead
========
artificial bismuth was commonly used in place of the actual mineral it was made by hammering tin into thin plates and cementing them by a mixture of white tartar  saltpeter  and  arsenic  stratified in a crucible over an open fire
========
bismuth was also known to the  incas  and used along with the usual copper and tin in a special  bronze   alloy  for knives
========
in the earths crust bismuth is about twice as abundant as gold  it is not usually economical to mine it as a primary product  rather it is usually produced as a byproduct of the processing of other metal ores especially lead but also  tungsten  or other metal alloys
========
the most important  ores  of bismuth are  bismuthinite  and  bismite  in 2005 china was the top producer of bismuth with at least 40 of the world share followed by mexico and peru reports the  british geological survey
========
according to the  usgs  world 2006 bismuth mine production was 5700 tonnes of which china produced 3000 tonnes mexico 1180 tonnes peru 950 tonnes and the balance canada kazakhstan and other nations  world 2006 bismuth refinery production was 12000 tonnes of which china produced 8500 tonnes mexico 1180 tonnes belgium 800 tonnes peru 600 tonnes japan 510 tonnes and the balance canada and other nations
========
the difference between world bismuth mine production and refinery production reflects bismuths status as a byproduct metal  bismuth travels in crude  lead  bullion which can contain up to 10 bismuth through several stages of refining until it is removed by the  krollbetterton process  or the  betts process   the krollbetterton process uses a pyrometallurgical separation from molten lead of calciummagnesiumbismuth drosses containing associated metals silver gold zinc some lead copper tellurium and arsenic which are removed by various fluxes and treatments to give highpurity bismuth metal over 99 bi  the betts process takes cast anodes of lead bullion and electrolyzes them in a lead fluosilicatehydrofluosilicic acid electrolyte to yield a pure lead cathode and an anode slime containing bismuth  bismuth will behave similarly with another of its major metals copper  thus world bismuth production from refineries is a more complete and reliable statistic

according to the bismuth advocate news ban the price ny dealer for bismuth metal from yearend 2000 to september 2005 was stuck in a range from lows of 270310 per lb in late november 2002 and 260290 per lb in december 2003 to highs of 385415 per lb at yearend 2000 and 365400 per lb in mid june 2004  ban shows the range pressing to 420460 per lb in september 2005 and then 450475 per pound in mid september 2006 before bursting upwards steeply to 600650 per lb in mid november 2006 730780 in late december 2006 925975 per lb in early march 2007 10501100 per lb in late march 2007 13001450 per lb in mid april 2007 to an alltime high of 18001900 per lb in mid june 2007 and then backed off to 13501500 per lb in mid november 2007  this unprecedented event reflects an extreme scarcity of bismuth perhaps temporary

========
though virtually unseen in nature highpurity bismuth can form distinctive  hopper crystals  these colorful laboratory creations are typically sold to collectors bismuth is relatively nontoxic and has a low melting point just above 273 c so crystals may be grown using a household stove although the resulting crystals will tend to be lower quality than labgrown crystals
========
bismuth oxychloride is sometimes used in  cosmetics  bismuth subnitrate and  bismuth subcarbonate  are used in medicine  bismuth subsalicylate  the  active ingredient  in  peptobismol  is used as an  antidiarrheal  and to treat some other gastrointestinal diseases  also the product  bibrocathol  is an organic molecule containing bismuth and is used to treat eye infections  bismuth subgallate  the  active ingredient  in devrom is used as an internal deodorant to treat malodor from  flatulence  or  gas  and stool poop
========
some other current uses
many bismuth  alloys  have low  melting points  and are widely used for fire detection and suppression system safety devices
bismuth is used as an alloying agent in production of malleable irons
a carrier for  u 235 or u233 fuel in  nuclear reactors
bismuth has also been used in  solders  the fact that bismuth and many of its  alloys  expand slightly when they solidify make them ideal for this purpose
bismuth subnitrate is a component of  glazes  that produces an  iridescent  luster finish
 bismuth telluride  is an excellent  thermoelectric  material it is widely used
a replacement propellant for  xenon  in  hall effect thrusters
in 1997 an antibody conjugate with bi213 which has a 45 minute halflife and decays with the emission of an alphaparticle was used to treat patients with leukemia
in 2001 professor barry allen and dr graeme melville at st george hospital in sydney successfully produced bi213 in linac experiments which involved bombarding radium with bremsstrahlung photons this cancer research team used bi213 in its targeted alpha therapy tat program
========
in the early 1990s research began to evaluate bismuth as a nontoxic replacement for lead in various applications
as noted above bismuth has been used in solders its low toxicity will be especially important for solders to be used in food processing equipment and copper water pipes
a pigment in artists oil paint
ingredient in freemachining  brasses  for  plumbing  applications
ingredient in freecutting steels for precision machining properties
a catalyst for making acrylic fibres
in lowmelting alloys used in fire detection and extinguishing systems
ingredient in  lubricating   greases
dense material for  fishing  sinkers
in crackling microstars  dragons eggs  in  pyrotechnics  as the  oxide   subcarbonate  or subnitrate
replacement for lead in  shot  and  bullets   the  uk   us  and many other countries now prohibit the use of lead shot for the hunting of wetland birds as many birds are prone to  lead poisoning  due to mistaken ingestion of lead instead of small stones and grit to aid digestion bismuthtin alloy shot is one alternative that provides similar ballistic performance to lead another less expensive but also more poorly performing alternative is steel shot which is actually soft iron
bismuth core bullets are also starting to appear for use in indoor shooting ranges where fine particles of lead from bullets impacting the backstop can be a chronic toxic inhalant problem owing to bismuths crystalline nature the bismuth bullets shatter into a nontoxic powder on impact making recovery and recycling easy    the lack of  malleability  does however make bismuth unsuitable for use in expanding hunting bullets
 fabrique nationale de herstal  uses bismuth in the projectiles for its  fn 303   lesslethal   riot gun
