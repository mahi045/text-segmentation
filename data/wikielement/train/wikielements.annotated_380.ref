hydrogen    is from  ancient greek   ὕδωρ  hydor water and genes forming  ancient greek   γείνομαι  geinomai to beget or sire
========
the word hydrogen has several different meanings
 the name of an element
 an atom sometimes called h dot that is abundant in space but essentially absent on earth because it  dimerizes
 a  diatomic molecule  that occurs naturally in trace amounts in the  earths atmosphere   chemists  increasingly refer to h2 as dihydrogen or hydrogen molecule to distinguish this  molecule  from  atomic hydrogen  and hydrogen found in other compounds
 the atomic constituent within all organic compounds water and many other  chemical compounds
========
the elemental forms of hydrogen should not be confused with hydrogen as it appears in chemical compounds

for other uses of this term see  helium disambiguation

========
helium he is a colorless odorless tasteless nontoxic  inert   monatomic   chemical element  that heads the  noble gas  series in the  periodic table  and whose   atomic number  is 2 its  boiling  and  melting  points are the lowest among the elements and it exists only as a  gas  except in extreme conditions extreme conditions are also needed to create the small handful of helium  compounds  which are all unstable at  standard temperature and pressure  it has a second rare  stable isotope  which is called  helium3   the behavior of liquid  helium4 s two fluid phases helium i and helium ii is important to researchers studying  quantum mechanics  in particular the phenomenon of  superfluidity  and to those looking at the effects that temperatures near  absolute zero  have on  matter  such as  superconductivity
========
helium is the second most  abundant  and second lightest element in the universe and is one of the elements believed to have been created in the  big bang  in the modern universe almost all new helium is created as a result of the  nuclear fusion  of hydrogen in  stars  on  earth  it is created by the  radioactive decay  of much heavier elements  alpha particles  are helium nuclei after its creation part of it is trapped with  natural gas  in concentrations up to 7 by volume  it is extracted from the natural gas by a low temperature separation process called  fractional distillation
========
in 1868 the french astronomer  pierre janssen   first detected  helium as an unknown yellow   spectral line  signature in light from a  solar eclipse  since then large reserves of helium have been found in the  natural gas fields  of the united states which is by far the largest supplier of the gas it is used in  cryogenics  in deepsea breathing systems to cool  superconducting magnets  in  helium dating  for inflating balloons for providing lift in  airships  and as a protective gas for many industrial uses such as   arc welding  and growing  silicon  wafers
========
helium is the least reactive member of the  noble gas  elements and thus also the least reactive of all elements it is  inert  and  monatomic  in virtually all conditions due to heliums relatively low molar molecular mass in the gas phase it has a  thermal conductivity   specific heat  and  sound conduction velocity  that are all greater than any gas except  hydrogen  for similar reasons and also due to the small size of its molecules heliums  diffusion  rate through  solids  is three times that of air and around 65 that of hydrogen
========
helium is less water  soluble  than any other gas known   and heliums  index of refraction  is closer to unity than that of any other gas   helium has a negative  joulethomson coefficient  at normal ambient temperatures meaning it heats up when allowed to freely expand only below its  joulethomson inversion temperature  of about 40  k  at 1 atmosphere does it cool upon free expansion once precooled below this temperature helium can be liquefied through expansion cooling
