fermium    is a  synthetic element  with the symbol fm and  atomic number  100 a highly  radioactive   metallic   transuranic  element of the  actinide  series fermium is made by bombarding  plutonium  with  neutrons  and is named after nuclear physicist  enrico fermi
========
only small amounts of fermium have ever been produced or isolated thus relatively little is known about its chemical properties only the iii  oxidation state  of the element appears to exist in aqueous solution 254fm and heavier  isotopes  can be synthesized by intense  neutron  bombardment of lighter elements especially  uranium  and  plutonium  during this successive  neutron captures  mixed with  beta decays  build the fermium isotope the intense neutron bombardment conditions needed to create fermium exist in  thermonuclear explosions  and can be replicated in the laboratory such as in the  high flux isotope reactor  at  oak ridge national laboratory  the synthesis of element 102  nobelium  was confirmed when 250fm was chemically identified there are no known uses of fermium outside of basic research fermium is the eighth  transuranic element
========
fermium after  enrico fermi  was first  discovered  by a team led by  albert ghiorso  in  1952  the team found 255fm in the debris of the first  hydrogen bomb  explosion see  operation ivy  that isotope was created when 238u combined with 17 neutrons in the intense temperature and pressure of the explosion eight beta decays also occurred to create the element the work was overseen by the  university of california radiation laboratory   argonne national laboratory  and  los alamos scientific laboratory  whose team members included ghiorso  stanley g thompson   gary h higgins   glenn t seaborg  from the radiation laboratory and department of chemistry of the university of california  martin h studier   pr fields   sherman m fried   h diamond   jf mech   gl pyle   john r huizenga   a hirsch   wm manning  from the argonne national laboratory  ci browne   h louise smith  and  rw spence  from the los alamos scientific laboratory samples of sea coral impacted from the first thermonuclear explosion of november 1952 were used
========
all these findings were kept secret until  1955  due to  cold war  tensions however in late  1953  and early  1954  a team from the  nobel institute of physics  in  stockholm  bombarded a 238 u  target with 16 o  ions producing an  alphaemitter  with an  atomic weight  of 250 and with 100  protons  in other words element 250100 the nobel team did not claim discovery but the isotope they produced was later positively identified as 250fm
========
17  radioisotopes  of fermium have been characterized with the most stable being 257fm with a  halflife  of 1005 days 253fm with a halflife of 3 days 252fm with a halflife of 2539 hours and 255fm with a halflife of 2007 hours all of the remaining  radioactive  isotopes have halflives that are less than 54 hours and the majority of these have halflives that are less than 3 minutes this element also has 1  meta state  250mfm t 18 seconds the isotopes of fermium range in  atomic weight  from 242073  u  242fm to 259101 u 259fm

gold    is a  chemical element  with the symbol au from the  latin  aurum meaning shining dawn and  atomic number  79 it is a highly soughtafter  precious metal  which for many centuries has been used as  money  a  store of value  and in  jewelry  the metal occurs as  nuggets  or grains in rocks underground veins and in  alluvial deposits  it is one of the  coinage metals  gold is dense soft shiny and the most  malleable  and  ductile  of the known metals pure gold has a bright yellow color traditionally considered attractive
========
gold formed the basis for the  gold standard  used before the  fiat currency  monetary system was employed by the  international monetary fund  imf and the  bank for international settlements  bis it is specifically against imf regulations to base any currency against gold for all imf member states however currencies may be based on oil though such as the  opec   petrodollar  the  iso currency code  of gold  bullion  is xau
========
modern industrial uses include  dentistry  and  electronics  where gold has traditionally found use because of its good resistance to oxidative corrosion
========
chemically gold is a trivalent and univalent  transition metal  gold does not react with most chemicals but is attacked by  chlorine   fluorine   aqua regia  and  cyanide  gold dissolves in  mercury  forming  amalgam  alloys but does not react with it gold is insoluble in  nitric acid  which will dissolve silver and base metals and this is the basis of the gold refining technique known as inquartation and parting nitric acid has long been used to confirm the presence of gold in items and this is the origin of the colloquial term acid test referring to a gold standard test for genuine value
========
gold is the most  malleable  and  ductile  metal a single  gram  can be beaten into a sheet of one  square meter  or an  ounce  into 300  square feet  gold leaf can be beaten thin enough to become translucent the transmitted light appears greenish blue because gold strongly reflects yellow and red gold readily forms alloys with many other metals these alloys can be produced to increase the hardness or to create exotic colors see below native gold contains usually eight to ten percent  silver  but often much more mdash alloys with a silver content over 20 are called  electrum  as the amount of silver increases the color becomes whiter and the  specific gravity  becomes lower
========
gold is a good conductor of  heat  and  electricity  and is not affected by  air  and most  reagents  heat moisture  oxygen  and most  corrosive  agents have very little chemical effect on gold making it wellsuited for use in  coins  and  jewelry  conversely  halogens  will chemically alter gold and  aqua regia  dissolves it via formation of the chloraurate ion
========
common  oxidation states  of gold include 1 goldi or aurous compounds and 3 goldiii or auric compounds gold ions in solution are readily  reduced  and  precipitated  out as gold metal by adding any other metal as the reducing agent the added metal is  oxidized  and dissolves allowing the gold to be displaced from solution and be recovered as a solid precipitate
========
recent research undertaken by sir frank reith of the australian national university shows that microbes play an important role in forming gold deposits transporting and precipitating gold to form grains and nuggets that collect in alluvial deposits
========
high quality pure metallic gold is tasteless in keeping with its resistance to corrosion it is metal ions which confer taste to metals
