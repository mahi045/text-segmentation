the isotope 56fe is of particular interest to nuclear scientists a common misconception is that this isotope represents the most stable nucleus possible and that it thus would be impossible to perform fission or fusion on 56fe and still liberate energy this is not true as both 62ni and 58fe are more stable being the most stable nuclei however since 56fe is much more easily produced from lighter nuclei in nuclear reactions it is the endpoint of fusion chains inside  extremely massive stars  and is therefore common in the universe relative to other  metals
