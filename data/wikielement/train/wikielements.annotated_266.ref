the first largescale production of fluorine was needed for the  atomic bomb   manhattan project  in  world war ii  where the compound  uranium hexafluoride  uf6 was needed as a gaseous carrier of uranium to separate the 235u and 238u  isotopes  of  uranium  today both the  gaseous diffusion  process and the  gas centrifuge  process use gaseous uf6 to produce  enriched uranium  for  nuclear power  applications in the manhattan project it was found that elemental fluorine was present whenever uf6 was due to the spontaneous decomposition of this compound into uf4 and f2 the corrosion problem due to the f2 was eventually solved by electrolytically coating all uf6 carrying piping with nickel metal which resists fluorines attack joints and flexible parts were made from  teflon  then a very recently discovered  fluorocarbon  plastic which was not attacked by f2
