there is an account that caesium reacting with  fluorine  takes up more fluorine than it  stoichiometrically  should   it is possible that after the salt csfminus has formed the cs ion which has the same electronic structure as elemental  xenon  can like xenon be oxidised further by  fluorine  and form traces of a higher fluoride such as csf3 analogous to xef2
