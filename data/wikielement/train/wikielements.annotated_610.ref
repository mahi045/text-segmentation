leadii sulfate is poorly soluble as can be seen in the following diagram showing addition of so42 to a solution containing 01m of pb2 the ph of the solution is 45 as above that pb2 concentration can never reach 01m due to the formation of pboh2 observe that pb2 solubility drops 10000 fold as so42 reaches 01m
