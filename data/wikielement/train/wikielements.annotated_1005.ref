strontium is a bright silvery metal that is softer than  calcium  and even more reactive in  water  which strontium decomposes on contact with to produce  strontium hydroxide  and  hydrogen  gas it burns in air to produce both  strontium oxide  and  strontium nitride  but since it does not react with  nitrogen  below 380c it will only form the oxide spontaneously at room temperature it should be kept under  kerosene  to prevent  oxidation  freshly exposed strontium metal rapidly turns a  yellowish  color with the formation of the oxide finely powered strontium metal will ignite spontaneously in air volatile strontium salts impart a  crimson  color to  flames  and these salts are used in  pyrotechnics  and in the production of  flares  natural strontium is a mixture of four stable  isotopes
