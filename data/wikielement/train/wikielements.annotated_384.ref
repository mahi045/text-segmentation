========
because of its extremely low  index of refraction  the use of helium reduces the distorting effects of temperature variations in the space between  lenses  in some  telescopes
========
the age of  rocks  and  minerals  that contain  uranium  and  thorium   radioactive  elements that emit helium nuclei called  alpha particles  can be discovered by measuring the level of helium with a process known as  helium dating
========
the high thermal conductivity and sound velocity of helium is also desirable in  thermoacoustic refrigeration  the inertness of helium adds to the environmental advantage of this technology over conventional refrigeration systems which may contribute to ozone depleting and global warming effects
========
because helium alone is less dense than atmospheric air it will change the  timbre  not  pitch  of a persons voice when inhaled however inhaling it from a typical commercial source such as that used to fill balloons can be dangerous due to the risk of  asphyxiation  from lack of oxygen and the number of contaminants that may be present these could include trace amounts of other gases in addition to aerosolized lubricating oil
========
evidence of helium was first detected on  august 18   1868  as a bright yellow line with a  wavelength  of 58749 nanometres in the  spectrum  of the  chromosphere  of the  sun  by french astronomer  pierre janssen  during a total  solar eclipse  in  guntur   india  this line was initially assumed to be  sodium  on october 20 of the same year english astronomer  norman lockyer  observed a yellow line in the solar spectrum which he named the d3  line  for it was near the known d1 and d2 lines of sodium and concluded that it was caused by an element in the sun unknown on earth he and english chemist  edward frankland  named the element with the greek word for the sun ἥλιος helios

in 1907  ernest rutherford  and  thomas royds  demonstrated that an  alpha particle  is a helium  nucleus  in 1908 helium was first liquefied by dutch physicist  heike kamerlingh onnes  by cooling the gas to less than one  kelvin  he tried to solidify it by further reducing the temperature but failed because helium does not have a  triple point  temperature where the solid liquid and gas phases are at equilibrium it was first solidified in 1926 by his student  willem hendrik keesom  by subjecting helium to 25  atmospheres  of pressure
========
in 1938 russian physicist  pyotr leonidovich kapitsa  discovered that  helium4  has almost no  viscosity  at temperatures near  absolute zero  a phenomenon now called  superfluidity  in 1972 the same phenomenon was observed in helium3 by american physicists  douglas d osheroff   david m lee  and  robert c richardson
========
after an oil drilling operation in 1903 in  dexter   kansas   us  produced a gas geyser that would not burn kansas state geologist  erasmus haworth  collected samples of the escaping gas and took them back to the university of kansas at lawrence where with the help of chemists  hamilton cady  and  david mcfarland  he discovered that the gas contained by volume 72 nitrogen 15 methaneinsufficient to make the gas combustible 1 hydrogen and 12 of an unidentifiable gas with further analysis cady and mcfarland discovered that 184 of the gas sample was helium far from being a rare element helium was present in vast quantities under the american great plains available for extraction from natural gas
========
this put the  united states  in an excellent position to become the worlds leading supplier of helium following a suggestion by sir  richard threlfall  the  united states navy  sponsored three small experimental helium production plants during  world war i  the goal was to supply  barrage balloons  with the nonflammable lifting gas a  total of 200000 cubic feet 5700 m of 92 helium was produced in the program even though only a few cubic feet less than 100 liters of the gas had previously been obtained
========
although the extraction process using lowtemperature gas liquefaction was not developed in time to be significant during world war i production continued helium was primarily used as a lifting gas in lighterthanair craft this use increased demand during world war ii as well as demands for shielded arc  welding  helium was also vital in the atomic bomb  manhattan project
========
the  government of the united states  set up the  national helium reserve  in 1925 at  amarillo   texas  with the goal of supplying military  airships  in time of  war  and commercial airships in peacetime due to a us military embargo against germany that restricted helium supplies the  hindenburg  was forced to use  hydrogen  as the lift gas helium use following  world war ii  was depressed but the reserve was expanded in the 1950s to ensure a supply of liquid helium as a coolant to create oxygenhydrogen  rocket fuel  among other uses during the  space race  and  cold war  helium use in the united states in 1965 was more than eight times the peak wartime consumption
========
after the helium acts amendments of 1960 public law 86777 the  us bureau of mines  arranged for five private plants to recover helium from natural gas for this helium conservation program the bureau built a 425mile 684nbspkm pipeline from  bushton   kansas  to connect those plants with the governments partially depleted cliffside gas field near  amarillo   texas  this heliumnitrogen mixture was injected and stored in the cliffside gas field until needed when it then was further purified
========
by 1995 a billion cubic metres of the gas had been collected and the reserve was us14 billion in debt prompting the  congress of the united states  in 1996 to phase out the reserve the resulting helium privatization act of 1996 public law 104273 directed the  united states department of the interior  to start liquidating the reserve by 2005
========
helium produced before 1945 was about 98 pure 2  nitrogen  which was adequate for airships in 1945 a small amount of 999 helium was produced for welding use by 1949 commercial quantities of grade a 99995 helium were available
========
for many years the united states produced over 90 of commercially usable helium in the world extraction plants created in  canada   poland   russia  and other nations produced the remaining helium in the mid 1990s a new plant in arzew algeria producing 600mmcf came on stream with enough production to cover all of europes demand subsequently in 20042006 two additional plants one in ras laffen qatar and the other in skikda algeria were built but as of early 2007 ras laffen is functioning at 50 and skikda has yet to start up algeria quickly became the second leading producer of helium through this time both helium consumption and the costs of producing helium increased and during 2007 the major suppliers air liquide airgas and praxair all raised prices from 10 to 30

helium is the second most abundant element in the known universe after  hydrogen  and constitutes 23 of the elemental  mass  of the universe it is concentrated in stars where it is formed from  hydrogen  by the  nuclear fusion  of the  protonproton chain reaction  and  cno cycle  according to the  big bang  model of the early development of the universe the vast majority of helium was formed during  big bang nucleosynthesis  from one to three minutes after the big bang as such measurements of its abundance contribute to cosmological models
========
in the  earths atmosphere  the concentration of helium by volume is only 52 parts per million the concentration is low and fairly constant despite the continuous production of new helium because most helium in the earths atmosphere  escapes  into space by several processes
in the earths  heterosphere  a part of the upper atmosphere helium and other lighter gases are the most abundant elements
========
nearly all helium on earth is a result of  radioactive decay  the  decay product  is primarily found in minerals of  uranium  and  thorium  including  cleveites   pitchblende   carnotite   monazite  and  beryl  because they emit  alpha particles  which consist of helium nuclei he2 to which electrons readily combine in this way an estimated 34 litres of helium per year are generated per cubic kilometer of the earths crust in the earths crust the concentration of helium is 8 parts per billion in seawater the concentration is only 4 parts per trillion there are also small amounts in mineral  springs   volcanic  gas and meteoric iron the greatest concentrations on the planet are in  natural gas  from which most commercial helium is derived
