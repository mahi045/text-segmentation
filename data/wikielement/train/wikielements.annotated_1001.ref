hivaids some research has indicated a geographical link between regions of selenium deficient soils and peak incidences of  hiv  aids  infection for example much of  subsaharan africa  is low in selenium however  senegal  is not and also has a significantly lower level of aids infection than the rest of the continent aids appears to involve a slow and progressive  decline in levels of selenium in the body whether this decline in selenium levels is a direct result of the replication of hiv or related more generally to the overall malabsorption of nutrients by aids patients remains debated
