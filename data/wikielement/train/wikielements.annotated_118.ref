chemically boron is  electron deficient possessing a vacant  porbital  it is an  electrophile  compounds of boron often behave as  lewis acids  readily bonding with electronrich substances to compensate for borons electron deficiency the reactions of boron are dominated by such requirement for electrons  also boron is the least  electronegative  nonmetal meaning that it is usually  oxidized  loses electrons in reactions
========
boron is also similar to  carbon  with its capability to form stable  covalently bonded  molecular networks boron is also used for heat resistant alloys boron forms a polyatomic  bii such as b2f4
========
 in automobiles it is proposed that by reacting water with elemental boron hydrogen could be produced to be burnt in an internal combustion engine or fed to a fuel cell to generate electricity
========
both 10b 188 percent and 11b 812 percent possess  nuclear spin  that of boron10 has a value of 3 and that of boron11 32 these isotopes are therefore of use in  nuclear magnetic resonance  spectroscopy and spectrometers specially adapted to detecting the boron11 nucleus are available commercially the boron10 and boron11 nuclei also cause splitting in the  resonances  of attached nuclei
========
the 10b isotope is good at capturing  thermal neutrons  from  cosmic radiation   it then undergoes  fission   producing a  gamma ray  an  alpha particle  and a  lithium  ion when this happens inside of an  integrated circuit  the fission products may then dump charge into nearby chip structures causing data loss bit flipping or  single event upset  in critical  semiconductor  designs depleted boronconsisting almost entirely of 11bis used to avoid this effect as one of  radiation hardening  measures 11b is a byproduct of the  nuclear industry  11boron is also a candidate as a fuel for  aneutronic fusion
========
the 10b isotope is good at capturing  thermal neutrons  and this quality has been used in both radiation shielding and in  boron neutron capture therapy  where a tumor is treated with a compound containing 10b is attached to a muscle and the patient treated with a relatively low dose of thermal neutrons which go on to cause energetic and short range alpha radiation in the tissue treated with the boron isotope
========

in nuclear reactors 10b is used for reactivity control and in emergency shutdown systems it can serve either function in the form of  borosilicate  rods or as  boric acid  in  pressurized water reactors  boric acid is added to the reactor coolant when the plant is shut down for refueling it is then slowly filtered out over many months as fissile material is used up and the fuel becomes less reactive
========
in future manned interplanetary spacecraft 10b has a theoretical role as structural material as boron fibers or bn nanotube material which also would serve a special role in the radiation shield one of the difficulties in dealing with  cosmic rays  which are mostly high energy protons is that some secondary radiation from interaction of cosmic rays and spacecraft structural materials is in the form of high energy  spallation  neutrons such neutrons can be moderated by materials high in light elements such as structural polyethylene but the moderated neutrons continue to be a radiation hazard unless actively absorbed in a way which dumps the absorption energy in the shielding far away from biological systems among light elements that absorb thermal neutrons 6li and 10b appear as potential spacecraft structural materials able to do double duty in this regard
========
estimated global consumption of boron rose to a record 18 million tonnes of b2o3 in 2005 following a period of strong growth in demand from asia europe and north america boron mining and refining capacities are considered to be adequate to meet expected levels of growth through the next decade
the form in which boron is consumed has changed in recent years the use of beneficiated ores like  colemanite  has declined following concerns over  arsenic  content consumers have moved towards the use of refined borates or boric acid that have a lower pollutant content
========
increasing demand for boric acid has led a number of producers to invest in additional capacity eti mine opened a new 100000 tonnes per year capacity boric acid plant at emet in 2003  rio tinto  increased the capacity of its boron plant from 260000 tonnes per year in 2003 to 310000 tonnes per year by may 2005 with plans to grow this to 366000 tonnes per year in 2006
========
chinese boron producers have been unable to meet rapidly growing demand for high quality borates this has led to imports of disodium tetraborate growing by a hundredfold between 2000 and 2005 and boric acid imports increasing by 28 per year over the same period
========
the rise in global demand has been driven by high rates of growth in  fiberglass  and borosilicate production a rapid increase in the manufacture of reinforcementgrade fiberglass in asia with a consequent increase in demand for borates has offset the development of boronfree reinforcementgrade fiberglass in europe and the usa the recent rises in energy prices can be expected to lead to greater use of insulationgrade fiberglass with consequent growth in the use of boron
========
roskill consulting group forecasts that world demand for boron will grow by 34 per year to reach 21 million tonnes by 2010 the highest growth in demand is expected to be in asia where demand could rise by an average 57 per year

the hardest boron compound is created synthetically  rhenium diboride  reb2 can actually scratch diamond giving it a higher than 10 rank in the mohs scale of mineral hardness and making it one of the three hardest substances known to man  the other two being  ultrahard fullerite  and  aggregated diamond nanorods

compounds of boron  arabic  buraq from  persian  burah from  turkish  bor have been known of for thousands of years in early egypt  mummification  depended upon an ore known as  natron  which contained borates as well as some other common salts borax  glazes  were used in  china  from 300 ad and boron compounds were used in glassmaking in ancient rome

the element was not isolated until  1808  by sir  humphry davy   joseph louis gaylussac  and  louis jacques thénard  to about 50 percent purity by the  reduction  of  boric acid  with  sodium  or  magnesium   these men did not recognize the substance as an element it was  jöns jakob berzelius  in 1824 who identified boron as an element the first pure boron was produced by the american chemist w weintraub in 1909 although this is disputed by some researchers
