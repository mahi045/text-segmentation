highlycombustible materials that leave little residuum such as wood or coal were thought of as made mostly of phlogiston whereas noncombustible substances that corrode such as  iron  contained very little air did not play a role in phlogiston theory and no initial quantitative experiments were conducted to test the idea instead it was based on observations of what happened when something burns that most common objects appear to become lighter and seem to lose something in the process
