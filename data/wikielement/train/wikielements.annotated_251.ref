251cf is famous for having a very small  critical mass  high lethality and short period of toxic environmental irradiation relative to radioactive elements commonly used for radiation explosive weaponry creating speculation about possible use in  pocket nukes  this  urban legend  is unfounded since it would be very difficult to make a 251cf bomb weighing less than 2nbspkg and the costs of such a bomb would be prohibitive  other weaponry uses such as showering an area with californium are not impossible but are seen as inhumane and are subject to inclement weather conditions and porous terrain considerations  often cited as a consideration is the cost of producing californium in quantity but the cost citations are usually due to extra fees that laboratory materials companies insert for sake of caution and market needs
========
pertaining to californiums  nuclear fuel cycle  it is important to make sure that the  curium  concentration in  mox nuclear fuel  is kept low as  neutron  irradiation of curium will convert some of it to californium the californium will then cause the used fuel to be more difficult to handle as the californium is a strong  neutron  emitter through spontaneous fission hence the concentration of curium and californium among the  minor actinides  are important
========
californium was  first synthesized  at the   university of california berkeley  by researchers  stanley g thompson   kenneth street jr   albert ghiorso  and  glenn t seaborg  in 1950 it was the sixth  transuranium element  to be discovered and the team announced their discovery on  march 17   1950  it was named after the us state of  california  and for the  university of california  system
========
to produce element 98 the team bombarded a microgramsized target of 242 cm  with 35 mev  alpha particles  in the 5foot 152nbspm berkeley  cyclotron  which produced atoms of 245cf halflife 44 minutes and a  free neutron
========
due to its 27 million per gram price tag only 8 grams of 252cf have been made in the western world since its discovery by seaborg in 1950   plutonium supplied by the  united kingdom  to the us under the  1958 usuk mutual defence agreement  was used for californium production
========
nineteen  radioisotopes  of californium have been characterized the most stable being 251cf with a  halflife  of 898 years 249cf with a halflife of 351 years and 250cf with a halflife of 13 years  all of the remaining  radioactive  isotopes have halflives that are less than 27 years and the majority of these have halflives shorter than 20 minutes the isotopes of californium range in  atomic weight  from 237062  u  237cf to 256093 u 256cf
========
although californium does not occur naturally on earth the element and its decay products occur elsewhere in the universe  their electromagnetic emissions are regularly observed in the spectra of  supernovae

caesium or cesium    is the  chemical element  with the symbol cs and  atomic number  55 it is a soft silverygold  alkali metal  with a melting point of       which makes it one of the metals that are liquid at or near  room temperature  along with  rubidium         francium         mercury        and  gallium        this element is most notably used in  atomic clocks
========
the variant spelling cesium is used especially in  north american english  and the  iupac  has recognized it as a variant spelling since 1993   but caesium is the spelling used by the iupac
========
the  emission spectrum  of caesium has two bright lines in the blue part of the spectrum along with several other lines in the red yellow and green this metal is silvery gold in color and is both soft and ductile caesium is the second most  electropositive  and  alkaline  of the  chemical elements  and has the second lowest  ionization potential  after  francium  caesium is the least abundant of the five nonradioactive alkali metals  technically francium is the least common alkali metal but since it is highly radioactive with an estimated 30 grams in the entire  earths crust  at one time its abundance can be considered zero in practical terms
========
along with  gallium  francium and  mercury  caesium is among the only metals that are liquid at or near room temperature caesium reacts explosively in cold  water  and also reacts with ice at temperatures above       157nbspk
========
 caesium hydroxide  csoh is a very strong  base  and will rapidly etch the surface of  glass   csoh is often stated to be the strongest base but in fact many compounds such as  nbutyllithium  and  sodium amide  are stronger
