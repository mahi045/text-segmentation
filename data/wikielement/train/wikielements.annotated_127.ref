berkelium    or    is a  synthetic element  with the symbol bk and  atomic number  97 a  radioactive   metallic  element in the  actinide  series berkelium was first synthesized by bombarding  americium  with  alpha particles   helium   ions  and was named after  berkeley california  and the  university of california berkeley  berkelium was the fifth  transuranic element  to be synthesized
========
weighable amounts of 249bk halflife 314 days make it possible to determine some of its properties using macroscopic quantities   as of 2004  it had not been isolated in its elemental form but it is predicted to be a silvery metal that would easily  oxidize  in air at elevated temperatures and would be  soluble  in dilute  mineral acids
========
 xray diffraction  techniques have been used to identify various berkelium  compounds  such as  berkelium dioxide bko2 berkelium fluoride bkf3 berkelium oxychloride bkocl and berkelium trioxide bko3 in  1962  visible amounts of berkelium  chloride  bkcl3 were isolated that weighed 3 billionths of a  gram  this was the first time visible amounts of a pure berkelium compound were produced
========
like other actinides berkelium  bioaccumulates  in  skeletal  tissue   this element has no known uses outside of basic research and plays no biological role
========
berkelium was  first synthesized  by  glenn t seaborg   albert ghiorso  stanley g thompson and kenneth street jr at the  university of california berkeley  in december  1949  the team used a  cyclotron  to bombard a  milligram sized target of 241 am  with  alpha particles  to produce 243bk  halflife  45 hours and two  free neutrons  one of the longest lived  isotopes  of the element 249bk halflife 330 days was later synthesized by subjecting a 244 cm  target with an intense beam of  neutrons
========
19  radioisotopes  of berkelium have been characterized with the most stable being 247bk with a  halflife  of 1380 years 248bk with a halflife of 9 years and 249bk with a halflife of 330 days  all of the remaining  radioactive  isotopes have halflives that are less than 5 days and the majority of these have halflives that are less than 5 hours this element also has 2  meta states  with the most stable being 248mbk t 237 hours the isotopes of berkelium range in  atomic weight  from 235057  u  235bk to 254091 u 254bk

bismuth    is a  chemical element  that has the symbol bi and  atomic number  83 this heavy brittle white crystalline trivalent  poor metal  has a pink tinge and chemically resembles  arsenic  and  antimony  of all the metals it is the most naturally  diamagnetic  and only  mercury  has a lower  thermal conductivity
