the  isotope  curium248 has been synthesized only in milligram quantities but curium242 and curium244 are made in multigram amounts which allows for the determination of some of the elements properties curium244 can be made in quantity by subjecting  plutonium  to  neutron  bombardment curium does not occur in nature there are few commercial applications for curium but it may one day be useful in radioisotope thermoelectric generators curium  bioaccumulates  in  bone  tissue where its radiation destroys   bone marrow  and thus stops  red blood cell  creation
