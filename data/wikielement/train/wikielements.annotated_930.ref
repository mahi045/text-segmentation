rhodium    is a  chemical element  with the symbol rh and  atomic number  45 a rare silverywhite hard  transition metal  and a member of the  platinum group  rhodium is found in platinum ores and is used in  alloys  with platinum and as a  catalyst  it is usually the most expensive  precious metal  though it is sometimes surpassed by  rhenium  depending on the market
========
rhodium is a hard silvery white and durable metal that has a high  reflectance  rhodium metal does not normally form an  oxide  even when heated  oxygen  is absorbed from the  atmosphere  at the  melting point  of rhodium but on solidification the oxygen is released rhodium has both a higher melting point and lower  density  than  platinum   it is not attacked by  acids  it is completely insoluble in  nitric acid  and dissolves slightly in  aqua regia  a complete dissolution of rhodium in powder form is only obtained in  sulfuric acid
========
the primary use of this element is as an alloying agent for hardening  platinum  and  palladium  these alloys are used in furnace windings bushings for glass fiber production  thermocouple  elements  electrodes  for aircraft  spark plugs  and laboratory crucibles other uses include
it is used as an  electrical contact  material due to its low  electrical resistance  low and stable  contact resistance  and its high  corrosion  resistance
plated rhodium made by  electroplating  or evaporation is extremely hard and is used for optical instruments
this metal finds use in  jewelry  and for decorations it is electroplated on  white gold  and platinum to give it a reflective white surface this is known as rhodium flashing in the jewelry business it also may be used in coating  sterling silver  in order to strengthen the metal from tarnish as a result from the copper compound found in  sterling silver
it is also a highly useful  catalyst  in a number of industrial processes notably it is used in the catalytic system of automobile  catalytic converters  and for catalytic carbonylation of methanol to produce  acetic acid  by the  monsanto process  it is used to catalyse addition of hydrosilanes to a double bond a process important in manufacture of certain silicone rubbers
the complex of a rhodium ion with  binap  gives a widely used chiral catalyst for  chiral synthesis  as in the synthesis of  menthol
it is also used as a filter in  mammography  systems because of the characteristic xrays it produces
========
rhodium  greek  rhodon meaning rose was  discovered  in  1803  by  william hyde wollaston  soon after his discovery of  palladium  he made this discovery in  england  using crude  platinum  ore that he presumably obtained from  south america
========
his procedure involved dissolving the ore in  aqua regia  neutralizing the acid with  sodium hydroxide   na  o  h  he then precipitated the platinum by adding   ammonium chloride   nh 4 cl  as  ammonium chloroplatinate  the element palladium was removed as  palladium cyanide  after treating the solution with  mercuric cyanide  the material that remained was a red  rhodiumiii chloride  hence the name rhodium metal was isolated via reduction with  hydrogen  gas
========
the industrial extraction of rhodium is complex as the metal occurs in ores mixed with other metals such as  palladium   silver   platinum  and  gold  it is found in platinum ores and obtained free as a white inert metal which it is very difficult to fuse principal sources of this element are located in south africa in river sands of the  ural mountains  in north and south america and also in the  copper  nickel sulfide  mining area of the  sudbury ontario  region although the quantity at sudbury is very small the large amount of nickel ore processed makes rhodium recovery cost effective the main exporter of rhodium is south africa 80 followed by russia the annual world production of this element is only about 25  tons  and there are very few rhodium  minerals  it is generally  difficult to determine if a rock sample contains platinum group elements as of october 2007 rhodium cost approximately eight times more than gold 450 times more than silver and 27250 times more than copper by weight rhodiums typical historical price is about 1000troy oz but in recent years it has increased to about 6150troy oz
========
it is also possible to extract rhodium from  used nuclear fuel  which contains rhodium 1 kg of the  fission products  of 235u contain 133 grams of 103rh so as a typical used fuel is 3 fission products by weight it will contain about 400 grams of rhodium per ton of used fuel the longest lived radioisotope of rhodium is 102mrh which has a half life of 29 years while the ground state 102rhhas a half life of 207 days
========
each kilo of fission rhodium will contain 662 ng of 102rh and 368 ng of 102mrh as 102rh decays by  beta decay  to either 102ru 80 some  positron emission  will occur or 102pd 20 some  gamma ray  photons with about 500 kev are generated and the excited state decays by beta decay electron capture to 102ru some  gamma ray  photons with about 1 mev are generated if the fission occurs in an instant then 133 grams of rhodium will contain 671 mbq 181 mci of 102rh and 108 mbq 291 Î¼ci of 102mrh as it is normal to allow used nuclear fuel to stand for about five years before reprocessing much of this activity will decay away leaving 47 mbq of 102rh and 50 mbq of 102mrh if the rhodium metal was then left for 20 years after fission then the 133 grams of rhodium metal would contain 13 kbq of 102rh and 500 kbq of 102mrh at first glance the rhodium might be adding to the resource value of reprocessed fission waste but the cost of the separation of the rhodium from the other metals needs to be considered
