for largescale use helium is extracted by  fractional distillation  from  natural gas  which contains up to 7 helium since helium has a lower boiling point than any other element low temperature and high pressure are used to liquefy nearly all the other gases mostly  nitrogen  and  methane  the resulting crude helium gas is purified by successive exposures to lowering temperatures in which almost all of the remaining nitrogen and other gases are precipitated out of the gaseous mixture  activated charcoal  is used as a final purification step usually resulting in 99995 pure gradea helium the principal impurity in gradea helium is  neon  in a final production step most of the helium that is produced is liquefied via a  cryogenic  process  this is necessary for  applications requiring liquid helium and also allows helium suppliers to reduce the cost of long distance transportation as the largest liquid helium containers have more than five times the capacity of the largest gaseous helium tube trailers
