also used in no no2 nox analyzers in power plants for pollution controls at 350 c the element acts as a catalyst for no2nox to form only no molecules for consistent readings by infrared light

molybdenite from the greek μόλυβδος molybdos meaning lead the principal ore from which molybdenum is now extracted was previously known as molybdena molybdena was confused with and often implemented as though it were  graphite  even when the two ores were distinguishable molybdena was thought to be a  lead  ore
========
it was not until 1778 that  swedish  chemist  carl wilhelm scheele  realized molybdena was neither graphite nor lead he and other chemists then correctly assumed that it was the ore of a distinct new element named molybdenum for the mineral in which it was discovered  peter jacob hjelm  successfully isolated molybdenum using  carbon  and  linseed oil  in 1781
for a long time there was no industrial use for molybdenum the french  schneider electrics  company produced the first steel molybdenum alloy armor plates in 1894 until  world war i  most other armor factories also used molybdenum alloys in  world war i  some british tanks were protected by 75nbspmm  manganese  plating but this proved to be ineffective the manganese plates were then replaced with 25nbspmm molybdenum plating these allowed for higher speed greater manueverability and despite being thinner better protection
========
molybdenum dusts and fumes as can be generated by mining or metalworking are not toxic there are no longterm effects associated with exposure to molybdenum however prolonged exposure can cause irritation to the eyes and skin the direct inhalation or ingestion of molybdenum should also be avoided  osha  regulations specify the maximum permissible molybdenum exposure in an 8hour day to be 5 mgm chronic exposure to 60 to 600 mg mom can cause symptoms including fatigue headaches and joint pains

meitnerium    also called  eka  iridium  is a  chemical element  in the  periodic table  that has the symbol mt and  atomic number  109 it is a  synthetic element  whose most stable isotope is mt276 with a  halflife  of 720  milliseconds
========
meitnerium was  first synthesized  on  august 29   1982  by a german research team led by  peter armbruster  and  gottfried münzenberg  at the  institute for heavy ion research  gesellschaft für schwerionenforschung in  darmstadt
the team bombarded a target of  bismuth 209 with accelerated nuclei of  iron 58 and  isotope  meitnerium266 was produced

the synthesis of this element demonstrated that  nuclear fusion  techniques could be used to make new heavy nuclei
========
the name meitnerium was suggested in honor of the austrian physicist and mathematician  lise meitner  but there was an  element naming controversy  as to what the elements from 101 to 109 were to be called thus  iupac  adopted unnilennium    symbol une as a temporary  systematic element name   in  1997  however the dispute was resolved and the current name was adopted

nitrogen    is a  chemical element  which has the symbol n and  atomic number  7 elemental nitrogen is a colorless odorless tasteless and mostly  inert   diatomic  gas at  standard conditions  constituting 781 by volume of  earths atmosphere  nitrogen is a constituent element of  amino acids  and therefore of all living  organisms  many industrially important compounds such as  ammonia   nitric acid  and  cyanides  contain nitrogen
========
nitrogen is a  nonmetal  with an  electronegativity  of 30 it has five  electrons  in its outer shell and is therefore  trivalent  in most compounds the triple bond in molecular nitrogen n2 is one of the strongest in nature the resulting difficulty of converting n2 into other compounds and the ease and associated high energy release of converting nitrogen compounds into elemental n2 have dominated the role of nitrogen in both nature and human economic activities
========
at  atmospheric pressure  molecular nitrogen  condenses   liquifies  at 77nbsp k  1958nbsp c  and  freezes  at 63nbspk 2100nbspc into the beta  hexagonal closepacked  crystal  allotropic  form below 354nbspk 2376nbspc nitrogen assumes the alpha  cubic  crystal allotropic form  liquid nitrogen  a fluid resembling water but with 808 of the density is a common  cryogen
