johannesburg much like  los angeles  is a young and sprawling city geared towards private motorists and lacks a convenient public transportation system a significant number of the citys residents are dependent on the citys informal minibus taxis
========
johannesburgs  metro railway  system connects central johannesburg to  soweto   pretoria  and most of the satellite towns along the  witwatersrand  the railways transport huge numbers of workers every day  however the railway infrastructure was built in johannesburgs infancy and covers only the older areas in the citys south in the past half century   johannesburg has grown largely northwards and none of the northern areas including the key business districts of  sandton   midrand   randburg  and  rosebank  have any rail infrastructure
========

========
the minibus taxis are the de facto standard and essential form of transport for the majority of the population since the  1980s  the minibus taxi industry has been severely affected by  turf wars
========
although essential these taxis are often of a poor standard in not only roadworthiness but also in terms of driver quality with a majority   of taxi drivers breaking traffic laws regularly such as driving in the emergency lane while speeding on a highway with the high demand for transport by the working class of south africa minibus taxis are often overfilled with passengers causing yet another hazard for road users however without subsidies from government and a lack of other feasible public transport minibus taxis will remain an essential form of transport for many of joburgs working class
