because of several problems the most obvious being the lack of support from the portuguese metropolis most captaincies failed one of the few to prosper was the captaincy of pernambuco which was assigned to  duarte coelho pereira  the man who founded  olinda  and became famous for expressing his enchantment with the beauty of the place giving the name to the city
