 guanabara bay  was reached by portuguese explorers in an expedition led by  portuguese  explorer  gaspar de lemos  on  january 20   1502  hence rio de janeiro january river there is a legend that the mariners named the place thus because they thought the mouth of the bay was actually the mouth of a river but no experienced sailor would make that mistake at the time river was the general word for any large body of water
========
an unofficial european presence in the area began not long after in 1519 when  ferdinand magellan  resupplied his ships in the bay french smugglers were already using the bay as a post for smuggling  brazilwood   when  french  naval officer  nicolas durand de villegaignon  arrived in 1555 with a fleet of two ships and 600 soldiers and colonists he founded the first permanent european settlement in the area  the colony was referred to as  france antarctique  the colonists consisted of mainly french  huguenots  and  swiss   calvinists  villegaignon left in 1557 after disputes with some of the colonists
========
the city was founded on  march 1   1565  by portuguese  knight   estácio de sá  who called it são sebastião do rio de janeiro 20 st sebastian of the january 20th river in honour of  saint sebastian  day of death traditionally on january 20 for centuries the settlement was commonly called são sebastião  or even saint sebastian  instead of the currently popular second half of its name the city was founded as a base from which to invade the french settlement  they succeeded in 1567 and the french were expelled  later  são sebastião was frequently attacked by  pirates  and  privateers  especially by then enemies of portugal such as the  netherlands  and  france
========
the exact place of rios foundation is at the foot of  pãodeaçúcar  sugarloaf mountain later the whole city was moved within a palisade on top of a hill imitating the medieval european defense strategy of fortified  castles   the place has since then been called morro do castelo castle hill thus the city developed from the current center downtown see below southwards and then westwards with large parts built over reclaimed land an urban movement which continues today
========
in the late 16th century the portuguese crown began treating the village as a strategic location for the  atlantic  transit of ships between brazil the african colonies and europe fortresses were built and an alliance was formed with nearby native tribes to defend the settlement
========
against invaders  rios neighbor  niterói  for instance was founded by araribóia a tamoio indian chief for defensive purposes  sugar cane  was the first industry in the area first native and later african  slaves  were used for manual labor eventually the industry dwindled as higher quality sugar cane from northern brazil became more available

========
until early in the 18th century the city was threatened or invaded by several  mostly french   pirates  and  buccaneers  such as  jeanfrançois duclerc  and  rené duguaytrouin  after 1720 when the portuguese found  gold  and  diamonds  in the neighboring  captaincy  of  minas gerais  rio de janeiro became a much more useful port for exporting wealth than  salvador   bahia  which is much farther to the north in 1763 the colonial administration in portuguese america was moved to rio the city remained primarily a colonial capital until 1808 when the portuguese royal family and most of the associated  lisbon  nobles fleeing from  napoleon s invasion of portugal moved to rio de janeiro the kingdoms capital was transferred to the city which thus became the only european capital outside of europe as there was no physical space or urban structure to accommodate hundreds of noblemen who arrived suddenly many inhabitants were simply evicted from their homes
========
when  prince pedro i  proclaimed the independence of brazil in 1822 he decided to keep rio de janeiro as the capital of his new empire rio continued as the capital of brazil after 1889 when the  monarchy  was replaced by a  republic
========
until the early years of the 20th century the city was largely limited to the neighbourhood now known as the historic downtown business district see below on the mouth of guanabara bay the citys center of gravity began to shift south and west to the socalled zona sul south zone in the early part of the 20th century when the first tunnel was built under the mountains located between  botafogo  and the neighbourhood now known as  copacabana  that beachs natural beauty combined with the fame of the  copacabana palace  hotel the luxury hotel of the americas in the 1930s helped rio to gain the reputation it still holds today as a beach party town though this reputation has been somewhat tarnished in recent years by  favela  violence resulting from the  narcotics  trade plans for moving the nations capital city to the territorial centre had been occasionally discussed and when  juscelino kubitschek  was elected president in 1955 it was partially on the strength of promises to build a new capital though many thought that it was just  campaign   rhetoric  kubitschek managed to have  brasília  built at great cost by 1960 on  april 21  that year the capital of brazil was officially moved from rio de janeiro to brasília
========
between 1960 and 1975 rio was a citystate such as  vienna austria   hamburg germany  or  washington dc   united states  under the name  state of guanabara  after the bay it borders however for administrative and political reasons a presidential decree known as a fusão the fusion removed the citys federative status and merged it with the  state of rio de janeiro  in 1975 even today some  cariocas  advocate the return of municipal autonomy
