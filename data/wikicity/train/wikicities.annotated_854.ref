========
in 1934 the popular governor of leningrad  kirov  was assassinated because stalin apparently became increasingly paranoid about kirovs growth the death of kirov was used to ignite the  great purge  where supporters of trotsky and other suspected enemies of the soviet state were arrested then a series of criminal cases known as the  leningrad centre  and  leningrad affair  were fabricated and resulted in death sentences for many top leaders of leningrad and severe repressions of thousands of top officials and intellectuals

during the nazi siege of 1941  1944 the only ways to supply the city and suburbs inhabited by several millions were by aircraft or by cars crossing the frozen  lake ladoga  the nazis systematically shelled this route called the  road of life  so thousands of cars with people and food supplies had sank in the lake the situation in the city was especially horrible in the winter of 1941  1942 the german bombing raids destroyed most of the food reserves daily food ration was cut in october to    of bread for a worker and    for a woman or child on  20 november   1941  the rations were reduced to    and    respectively those grams of bread were the bulk of a daily meal for a person in the city the water supply was destroyed the situation further worsened in winter due to lack of heating fuel in december 1941 alone some 53000 people in leningrad died of starvation many corpses were scattered in the streets all over the city
========
savichevs died everyone died only tanya is left wrote 11yearold leningrad girl  tanya savicheva  in her diary this diary became one of the symbols of the blockade tragedy and was shown as one of many documents at the  nuremberg trials
========
the city suffered severe destruction  the wehrmacht fired about 150000 shells at leningrad and the luftwaffe dropped about 100000 air bombs many houses schools hospitals and other buildings were leveled and those in the occupied territory were plundered by german troops

for the heroic resistance of the city and tenacity of the survivors of the siege leningrad was the first city in the former ussr to be awarded the title  hero city  in 1945 some performance and cinema theatres were opened for public by middle of the 1946 and in may of 1947 the famous fountains of the  peterhof  park were reconstructed from ruins and opened for public again however the palaces of the tsars were in ruins for the next several decades as the country recovered from war
========

the war damaged the city and killed many old petersburgers who had not fled after the revolution and did not perish in the mass purges before the war nonetheless leningrad and many of its suburbs were rebuilt over the postwar decades partially according to the prewar plans in 1950 the  kirov stadium  was opened and soon set a record when 110000 fans attended a football match

========
however during the late 1940s and 1950s the entire political and cultural elite of leningrad suffered from more harsh repressions under dictatorship of stalin hundreds were executed and thousands were imprisoned in repressions known as the  leningrad affair independent thinkers writers artists and other intellectuals were attacked magazines zvezda and leningrad were banned  akhmatova  and  zoshchenko  were repressed and tens of thousands leningraders were exiled to siberia more crackdowns on the leningrads intellectual elite known as the second leningrad affair were part of the economic policies of the soviet state leningrads economy was producing about 6 of the ussr  gnp  having less than 2 of the countrys population but such economic efficiency was negated by the  soviet communist party  which diverted the income from people of leningrad to other soviet places and programs as a result during the 1960s 1970s and 1980s the city of leningrad was seriously underfunded in favor of moscow leningrad suffered from the imbalanced distribution of wealth because the soviet leadership drained the citys resources to subsidise higher standards of living in moscow as well as some underperforming parts of the soviet union and beyond such redistribution of wealth caused struggle within the soviet government and communist party which lead to their fragmentation and played a role in the eventual collapse of the ussr
