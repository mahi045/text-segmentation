the name mumbai is an  eponym   etymologically  derived from mumba or mahaamba the name of the  hindu  goddess  mumbadevi  and aai  mother in  marathi  the former name bombay had its origins in the  16th century  when the  portuguese  arrived in the area and called the place with various names which would finally take on the written form bombaim still common in current portuguese use after the  british  gained possession in the  17th century  it was  anglicised  to bombay although it was known as mumbai or mambai to marathi and gujaratispeakers and as bambai in hindi urdu and punjabi however even marathi and gujaratispeakers commonly used bombay when speaking in  english  the name was officially changed to its marathi pronunciation of mumbai in 1995
========

========
a widespread explanation of the origin of the traditional english name bombay holds that it would be derived from a portuguese name meaning good bay this is based on the fact that bom masc is portuguese for good whereas the english word bay is similar to the portuguese baía fem bahia in old spelling the normal portuguese rendering of good bay would have been boa bahia rather than the grammatically incorrect bom bahia however it is possible to find the form baim masc for little bay in sixteen century portuguese
========
other sources have a different origin for the portuguese  toponym  bombaim josé pedro machados dicionário onomástico etimológico da língua portuguesa portuguese dictionary of onomastics and etymology mentions what is probably the first portuguese reference to the place dated from  1516  as benamajambu or tenamaiambu pointing out that maiambu seems to refer to mumbadevi the hindu goddess after which the place is named in marathi mumbai in that same century the spelling seems to have evolved to mombayn 1525 and then mombaim 1563 the final form bombaim appears later in the 16th century as recorded by gaspar correia in his lendas da índia legends of india jp machado seems to reject the bom bahia hypothesis asserting that portuguese records mentioning the presence of a bay at the place led the english to assume that the noun bahia bay was an integral part of the portuguese toponym hence the english version bombay adapted from portuguese

present mumbai was originally an  archipelago  of  seven islands
artefacts found near  kandivali  in northern mumbai indicate that these islands had been inhabited since the  stone age  documented evidence of human habitation dates back to 250 bce when it was known as heptanesia  ptolemy   ancient greek  a cluster of seven islands in the 3rd century bce the islands formed part of the  maurya  empire ruled by the  buddhist  emperor  aşoka  during its first few centuries control over mumbai was disputed between the  indoscythian   western satraps  and the  satavahanas  the hindu rulers of the  silhara dynasty  later governed the islands until 1343 when the kingdom of  gujarat  annexed them some of the oldest edifices of the archipelago  the  elephanta caves  and the  walkeshwar temple complex  date from this era
========
in  1534  the  portuguese  appropriated the islands from  bahadur shah of gujarat  they were ceded to  charles ii of england  in 1661 as  dowry  for  catherine de braganza  these islands were in turn leased to the  british east india company  in 1668 for a sum of   10  per annum  the company found the deep  harbour  on the east coast of the islands to be ideal for setting up their first port in the subcontinent the population quickly rose from 10000 in 1661 to 60000 in 1675 in 1687 the british east india company transferred its headquarters from  surat  to bombay the city eventually became the headquarters of the  bombay presidency  from 1817 onwards the city was reshaped with large  civil engineering  projects aimed at merging all the islands in the archipelago into a single amalgamated mass this project known as the  hornby vellard  was completed by 1845 and resulted in the total area swelling to 438  km  in 1853 indias first passenger  railway  line was established connecting bombay to the town of  thane  during the  american civil war  18611865 the city became the worlds chief  cotton  trading market resulting in a boom in the economy and subsequently enhancing the citys stature

========
after 1955 when the  state of bombay  was being reorganised along linguistic lines into the states of  maharashtra  and  gujarat  there was a demand that the city be constituted as an autonomous citystate however the  samyukta maharashtra movement  opposed this and insisted that mumbai be declared the capital of maharashtra following a successful protests in which 105 people were killed by police firing maharashtra state was formed with mumbai as its capital on  may 1   1960

the late 1970s witnessed a construction boom and a significant influx of migrants which saw mumbai overtake  kolkata  as indias most populous city this  influx  caused unrest in local  maharashtrians  political outfit shivsena was formed by balasaheb thackeray for securing interests of sons of soil the citys secular fabric was torn apart in the  riots  of 199293 after large scale sectarian violence caused extensive loss of life and property a few months later on  march 12   a series of coordinated bombings  at several city landmarks by the  mumbai underworld  killed around three hundred people in 1995 the city was renamed mumbai by the shiv sena government of maharashtra in keeping with their policy of renaming colonial institutions after historic local appellations there have also been bomb explosions on public transport buses in the past couple of years in  2006  mumbai was also the site of a  major terrorist attack  in which over two hundred people were killed when several bombs exploded almost simultaneously on the  mumbai suburban railway
