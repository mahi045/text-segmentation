one of the biggest concerns with traffic in beijing deals with its apparently ubiquitous traffic jams traffic in the city centre is often gridlocked especially around rush hour even outside of rush hour several roads still remain clogged up with traffic urban area ring roads and major through routes especially near the  changan avenue  area are often clogged up during rush hour
========
recently expressways have been extended in some cases reconstructed as express routes into the territories within the  3rd ring road  as they are either expressways or express routes drivers do not need to pass through intersections with traffic lights this may finally solve the difficulties in hopping between one ring and another
========
another problem is that public transportation is underdeveloped the subway system is presently minimal and that even buses are jampacked with people around rush hour beijing was poorly designed in terms of zoning and in terms of transportation system       compounding the problem is patchy enforcement of traffic regulations and  road rage  beijing authorities claim that traffic jams may be a thing of a past come the  2008 olympics  the authorities have introduced several bus lanes where during rush hour all vehicles except for public buses must keep clear
