for a long time the view of the city was dominated by numerous orthodox churches the look of the city changed drastically during soviet times mostly due to  joseph stalin  who oversaw a largescale effort to modernise the city he introduced broad avenues and roadways some of them over ten lanes wide but he also destroyed a great number of historically significant architectural works the  sukharev tower  as well as numerous mansions and stores lining the major streets and various works of religious architecture such as the  kazan cathedral  and the  cathedral of christ the saviour  were all destroyed during stalins rule during the 1990s however both the latter were rebuilt

stalin however is also credited with building the  the seven sisters  comprising seven cathedrallike structures a defining feature of moscows skyline their imposing form was allegedly inspired by the  manhattan municipal building  in  new york city  and their stylenbsp with intricate exteriors and a large central spirenbsp has been described as  stalinist gothic architecture  all seven towers can be seen from most elevations in the city they are among the tallest constructions in central moscow apart from the  ostankino tower  which when it was completed in 1967 was the tallest freestanding land structure in the world and today remains the worlds secondtallest
the soviet policy of providing mandatory housing for every citizen and his or her family and the rapid growth of the muscovite population in soviet times also led to the construction of large monotonous housing blocks which can often be differentiated by age sturdiness of construction or style according to the neighbourhood and the materials used most of these date from the poststalin era and the styles are often named after the leader then in powernbsp brezhnev khrushchev etcnbsp and they are usually illmaintained
