vancouver is among british columbias youngest cities the settlement of  gastown  grew up quickly around the original makeshift  tavern  established by gassy  jack deighton  in 1867 on the edge of the hastings mill property
========
the city of vancouver was incorporated on  6 april   1886  the same year that the first transcontinental train arrived the name honouring george vancouver was chosen by cpr president  william van horne  who arrived in port moody to establish the cpr terminus recommended by  henry john cambie
========
during the 1898  klondike gold rush  vancouver merchants sold a great deal of equipment to prospectors
========
the economy of early vancouver was dominated by large companies such as the cpr which had the capital needed for the rapid development of the new city some manufacturing did develop but the resource sector was the backbone of vancouvers economy initially with logging and later with exports moved through the  seaport  where commercial traffic constituted the largest economic sector in vancouver by the 1930s

========
the dominance of the economy by big business was accompanied by an often militant  labour movement  the first major sympathy  strike  was in 1903 when railway employees struck against the cpr for union recognition labour leader frank rogers was killed while picketing at the docks by cpr police during that strike becoming the british columbia movements first martyr canadas first general strike occurred following the death of another labour leader  ginger goodwin  in 1918 at the  cumberland  coal mines on  vancouver island  a lull in industrial tensions through the later 1920s came to an abrupt end with the  great depression  most of the 1930s strikes were led by  communist party  organizers that strike wave peaked in 1935 when unemployed men flooded the city to protest conditions in the relief camps run by the military in remote areas throughout the province after two tense months of daily and disruptive protesting the  relief camp strikers  decided to take their grievances to the federal government and embarked on the  ontoottawa trek
========
other social movements such as the  firstwave feminist  moral reform and  temperance movements  were also influential in vancouvers development  mary ellen smith  a vancouver  suffragist  and  prohibitionist  became the first woman elected to a  provincial legislature  in canada in 1918 alcohol prohibition began in the  first world war  and lasted until 1921 when the provincial government established its control over alcohol sales which still persists today canadas first  drug law  came about following an inquiry conducted by the federal  minister of labour  and future  prime minister   william lyon mackenzie king  king was sent to investigate damages claims resulting from a riot when the  asiatic exclusion league  led a rampage through  chinatown  and  japantown  two of the claimants were  opium  manufacturers and after further investigation king found that white women were reportedly frequenting  opium dens  as well as  chinese  men a federal law banning the manufacture sale and importation of opium for nonmedicinal purposes was soon passed based on these revelations
========
 amalgamation  with point grey and south vancouver gave the city its final contours not long before taking its place as the third largest metropolis in the country as of  1 january   1929  the population of the enlarged vancouver was 228193 and it filled the entire peninsula between the  burrard inlet  and the fraser river
========

the original  vegetation  of most of vancouver and its suburbs was dense  temperate rain forest  consisting of  conifers  with scattered pockets of  maple  and  alder  as well as large areas of  swampland  even in upland areas due to poor  drainage
========

========
the conifers were a typical coastal british columbia mix of  douglasfir   western red cedar  and  western hemlock   thought to have been the greatest concentration of the largest of these trees on the entire  british columbia coast  only in  seattle s  elliott bay  did the trees rival those of  burrard inlet  and  english bay  in size the largest trees in vancouvers oldgrowth forest were in the  gastown  area where the first  logging  occurred and on the south slopes of  false creek  and english bay especially around  jericho beach  the forest in  stanley park  is mostly  second  and third growth and evidence of oldfashioned logging techniques such as springboard notches can still be seen there
========
a diverse collection of  plants  and  trees  were imported from other parts of the continent and from points across the  pacific  and can be found growing throughout vancouver and the  lower mainland  various species of  palm  trees have proven hardy in this climate and are a common sight as are large numbers of other exotic trees such as the  monkey puzzle tree  the  japanese maple  and various flowering exotics such as  magnolias   azaleas  and  rhododendrons  many rhododendrons have grown to immense sizes as have other species imported from harsher climates in  eastern canada  or  europe  the native  douglas maple  can also attain a tremendous size many streets in the city are lined with flowering varieties of  japanese cherry  trees that were donated by  japan  starting in the 1930s certain areas of  west vancouver  that have the right soil requirements are home to the  arbutus menziesii  tree

vancouvers climate is unusually temperate by canadian standards its winters are the fourth warmest of canadian cities monitored by  environment canada  after nearby  victoria   nanaimo  and  duncan  all of which are on vancouver island vancouver has daily minimum temperatures falling below 0nbsp c  32nbsp f  on an average of 46 days per year and below 10nbspc 14nbspf on only two days per year the average annual precipitation is about 1219nbspmillimetres 48nbsp in  though this varies dramatically throughout the city due to the topography the summer months are often very dry resulting in moderate  drought  conditions a few months of the year in contrast more than half of all winter days receive measurable precipitation on average  snow  falls on only eleven days per year with only three days receiving six or more centimetres 25nbspin or more
========

the  air quality  in the city has been generally improving some actions have been taken by various levels of government to limit the problem such as reducing automobile emissions by  vehicle emissions testing
========
while the number of cars in vancouver proper has been steadily rising with population growth the rate of car ownership and the average distance driven by daily commuters have fallen since the early 1990s vancouver is the only major canadian city with these trends despite the fact that the journey time per vehicle has increased by one third and growing traffic mass there are 7 fewer cars making trips into the downtown core residents have been more inclined to live in areas closer to their interests or use more energyefficient means of travel such as mass transit and cycling this is in part the result of a push by city planners for a solution to traffic problems and proenvironment campaigns  transportation demand management  policies have imposed restrictions on drivers making it more difficult and expensive to commute while introducing more benefits for nondrivers
