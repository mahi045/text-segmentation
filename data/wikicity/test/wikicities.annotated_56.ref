in 64 bc the  roman  general  pompey  annexed the western part of syria  they occupied damascus and subsequently incorporated it into the league of ten cities known as the  decapolis  because it was considered such an important center of grecoroman culture  according to the  new testament   st paul  was on the road to damascus when he received a vision was struck blind and as a result converted to  christianity  in  the year  37   roman emperor   caligula  transferred damascus into  nabataean  control by decree the nabataean king  aretas iv philopatris  ruled damascus from his capital  petra  however around the year  106  nabataea was conquered by the romans and damascus returned to roman control
========
damascus became a metropolis by the beginning of the second century and in 222 it was upgraded to a colonia by the emperor  septimius severus   with the coming of the  pax romana  damascus and the roman province of syria in general began to prosper  damascuss importance as a caravan city was evident with the trade routes from southern  arabia   palmyra   petra  and the silk routes from china all converging on it  the city satisfied the roman demands for eastern luxuries
========
little remains of the architecture of the romans but the town planning of the old city did have a lasting effect  the roman architects brought together the greek and aramaean foundations of the city and fused them into a new layout measuring approximately 1500 by 750 meters surrounded by a city wall  the city wall contained seven gates but only the eastern gate bab sharqi remains from the roman period  roman damascus lies mostly at depths of up to five meters below the modern city
========
the old borough of  bab tuma  was developed at the end of the romanbyzantine era by the local  eastern orthodox  community according to the  acts of the apostles   saint paul  and  saint thomas  both lived in that neighborhood  roman catholic  historians also consider  bab tuma  to be the birthplace of several  popes  such as  john v  and  gregory iii
========

 damascus was conquered  by the  rashidun caliphate  forces in  634  ad immediately thereafter the citys power and prestige reached its peak when it became the capital of the  umayyad empire  which extended from  spain  to  india  from  661  to  750  in  744  the last umayyad caliph  marwan ii  moved the capital to  harran  in the  jazira  and damascus was never to regain the political prominence it had held in that period
========
after the fall of the umayyads and the establishment of the  abbasid  caliphate in  750  damascus was ruled from  baghdad  although in  858   almutawakkil  briefly established his residence there with the intention of transferring his capital there from  samarra  however he soon abandoned the idea as the abbasid caliphate declined damascus suffered from the prevailing instability and came under the control of local dynasties in  875  the ruler of egypt  ahmad ibn tulun  took the city with abbasid control being reestablished only in  905  in  945  the  hamdanids  took damascus and not long after it passed into the hands of  muhammad bin tughj  founder of the  ikhshidid  dynasty in  968  and again in  971  the city was briefly captured by the  qaramita
========


in  970  the  fatimid  caliphs in  cairo  gained control of damascus this was to usher in a turbulent period in the citys history as the berber troops who formed the backbone of the fatimid forces became deeply unpopular among its citizens the presence in syria of the qaramita and occasionally of turkish military bands added to the constant pressure from the  bedouin  for a brief period from  978  damascus was selfgoverning under the leadership of a certain  qassam  and protected by a citizen militia however the ghouta was ravaged by the bedouin and after a turkishled campaign the city once again surrendered to fatimid rule from 1029 to 1041 the turkish military leader  anushtakin  was governor of damascus under the fatimid caliph  alzahir  and did much to restore the citys prosperity
========
it appears that during this period the slow transformation of damascus from a graecoroman city layout  characterised by blocks of  insulae   to a more familiar islamic pattern took place the grid of straight streets changed to a pattern of narrow streets with most residents living inside harat closed off at night by heavy wooden gates to protect against criminals and the exactions of the soldiery
========
with the arrival of the  seljuk turks  in the late 11th century damascus again became the capital of independent states it was ruled by a seljuk dynasty from 1079 to 1104 and then by another turkish dynasty  the  burid emirs  who withstood a  siege of the city  during the  second crusade  in 1148  in 1154 damascus was conquered from the burids by the famous  zengid  atabeg  nur addin  of  aleppo  the great foe of the  crusaders  he made it his capital and following his death it was acquired by  saladin  the ruler of egypt who also made it his capital saladin rebuilt the citadel and it is reported that under his rule the suburbs were as extensive as the city itself it is reported by  ibn jubayr  that during the time of saladin damascus welcomed seekers of knowledge and industrious youth from around the world who arrived for the sake of undistracted study and seclusion in damascus many colleges
========
in the years following saladins death in  1193  there were frequent conflicts between different  ayyubid sultans  ruling in damascus and cairo  damascus was the capital of independent ayyubid rulers betwen  1193  and  1201  from  1218  to  1238  from  1239  to  1245  and from  1250  to  1260   at other times it was ruled by the ayyubid rulers of egypt   damascus steel  gained a legendary reputation among the  crusaders  and patterned steel is still damascened the patterned byzantine and chinese silks available through damascus one of the western termini of the  silk road  gave the english language damask
========
ayyubid rule and independence came to an end with the mongol invasion of syria in  1260  and following the mongol defeat at  ain jalut  in the same year damascus became a provincial capital of the  mamluk empire  ruled from egypt following the mongol withdrawal
========

in  1400   timur  the  mongol  conqueror besieged damascus the mamluk sultan dispatched a deputation from cairo including  ibn khaldun  who negotiated with him but after their withdrawal he put the city to sack the umayyad mosque was burnt and men and women taken into slavery a huge number of the citys artisans were taken to timurs capital at  samarkand  these were the luckier citizens many were slaughtered and their heads piled up in a field outside the northeast corner of the walls where a city square still bears the name burj alruus originally the tower of heads
========
rebuilt damascus continued to serve as a mamluk provincial capital until 1516
========
in early  1516  the  ottoman turks  wary of the danger of an alliance between the mamluks and the persian  safavids  started a campaign of conquest against the mamluk sultanate on  21 september  the mamluk governor of damascus fled the city and on  2 october  the  khutba  in the umayyad mosque was pronounced in the name of  selim i  the day after the victorious sultan entered the city staying for three months on  15 december  he left damascus by bab aljabiya intent on the conquest of egypt little appeared to have changed in the city one army had simply replaced another however on his return in october 1517 the sultan ordered the construction of a mosque  taqiyya  and mausoleum at the shrine of shaikh  muhi aldin ibn arabi  in salihiyya this was to be the first of damascus great ottoman monuments
========
the ottomans remained for the next 400 years except for a brief occupation by  ibrahim pasha  of  egypt  from 1832  to 1840  because of its importance as the point of departure for one of the two great  hajj  caravans to  mecca  damascus was treated with more attention by the  porte  than its size might have warranted  for most of this period  aleppo  was more populous and commercially more important in 1560 the taqiyya alsulaimaniyya a mosque and  khan  for pilgrims on the road to mecca was completed to a design by the famous ottoman architect  sinan  and soon afterwards a  madrasa  was built adjoining it

perhaps the most notorious incident of these centuries was the massacre of christians in  1860  when fighting between  druze  most probably supported by foreign countries to weaken the economical power and  maronites  in  mount lebanon  spilled over into the city some thousands of christians were killed with many more being saved through the intervention of the algerian exile  abd alqadir  and his soldiers who brought them to safety in abd alqadirs residence and the citadel the christian quarter of the old city including a number of churches was burnt down the christian inhabitants of the notoriously poor and refractory midan district outside the walls were however protected by their muslim neighbours
========
in the early years of the twentieth century nationalist sentiment in damascus initially cultural in its interest began to take a political colouring largely in reaction to the  turkicisation  programme of the  committee of union and progress  government established in istanbul in 1908  the hanging of a number of patriotic intellectuals by  jamal pasha  governor of damascus in beirut and damascus in 1915  and 1916  further stoked nationalist feeling and in  1918  as the forces of the  arab revolt  and the  british army  approached residents fired on the retreating turkish troops
========


on  1 october   1918  the forces of the  arab revolt  led by  nuri assaid  entered damascus the same day australian soldiers from the 4th and 10th  light horse  regiments reinforced with detachments from the british  yeomanry mounted division  entered the city and accepted its surrender from the turkish appointed governor emir said installed as governor the previous afternoon by the retreating turkish commander     a military government under  shukri pasha  was named other british forces including  t e lawrence  followed later that day and  faisal ibn hussein  was proclaimed king of syria political tension rose in november 1917 when the new  bolshevik  government in  russia  revealed the  sykespicot agreement  whereby britain and france had arranged to partition the arab east between them a new francobritish proclamation on 17 november promised the complete and definitive freeing of the peoples so long oppressed by the turks the  syrian congress  in march adopted a democratic constitution however the  versailles conference  had granted  france  a  mandate  over syria and in 1920 a french army crossed the antilebanon mountains defeated a small syrian defensive expedition at the  battle of maysalun  and entered damascus the french made damascus capital of their  league of nations  mandate of syria
========
when in 1925  the  druze revolt  in the  hauran  spread to damascus the french repressed it brutally bombing and shelling the city the area of the old city between  souk alhamidiyya  and souk midhat pasha was burned to the ground with many deaths and has since then been known as alhariqa the fire the old city was surrounded with barbed wire to prevent rebels infiltrating from the ghouta and a new road was built outside the northern ramparts to facilitate the movement of armoured cars
========
on  21 june   1941  damascus was captured from the  vichy french  forces by the allies during the  syrialebanon campaign
