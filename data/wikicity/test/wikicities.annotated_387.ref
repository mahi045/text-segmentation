meanwhile in 1444 the  portuguese  arrived on the island of  gorée  founding a settlement there and by 1536 had begun using it as a base for the export of slaves  by this time the mainland of capvert was under control of the  jolof empire  as part of the western province of  cayor   which seceded from jolof in its own right in 1549 a new lebu village called ndakarou was established directly across from gorée in the 17th century to service the european trading factory with food and drinking water

gorée was captured by the  united netherlands  in 1588 who gave it its present name spelled goeree after  goereeoverflakkee  in holland the island was to switch hands between the portuguese and dutch a couple more times before falling to the english under  admiral holmes  on  23 january   1664  and finally to the  french  in 1677  though under continuous french administration after that  métis  families descendant from dutch and french traders and african wives dominated the slave trade the infamous  house of slaves  was built here in 1776

large public expenditure for infrastructure was allocated by the colonial authorities to dakars development the port facilities were improved with jetties a telegraph line was established along the coast to  saint louis  and the dakarsaint louis railway was completed in  1885  at which point the city became an important base for the conquest of the western sudan

in its colonial heyday dakar was one of the major cities of the french empire comparable to hanoi or beirut french trading firms established branch offices there and industrial investments mills breweries refineries canneries were attracted by its port and rail facilities it was also strategically important to france which maintained an important naval base and coaling station in its harbor and which integrated it into its earliest air force and airmail circuits most notably with the legendary mermoz airfield no longer extant

during the  battle of dakar  which took place off the coast of dakar on  september 23    september 25   1940  the british navy attempted to rally the colonial administration in dakar to the allied cause and detach it from vichy in  november 1944  west african conscripts of the french army mutinied against poor conditions at the thiaroye camp on the outskirts of the city the mutiny was seen as an indictment of the colonial system and constituted a watershed for the nationalist movement
