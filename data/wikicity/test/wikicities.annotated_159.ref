prior to the arrival of  french  explorers in  1673  the area that would become st louis was a major center of the  mississippian   mound builders   the presence of numerous mounds now almost all destroyed earned the later city the nickname of mound city
european exploration of the area had begun nearly a century before the city was founded   louis joliet  and  jacques marquette  both french traveled through the  mississippi river  valley in  1673  and five years later  la salle  claimed the entire valley for  france   he called it  louisiana  after king  louis xiv  the french also called their region  illinois country   in 1699 a settlement was established across the river from what is now st louis at  cahokia   other early settlements were downriver at  kaskaskia  prairie du pont  fort de chartres  and  saint genevieve   in 1703 catholic priests established a small mission at what is now st louis  the mission was later moved across the mississippi but the small river at the site now a drainage channel near the southern boundary of the city of st louis still bears the name river des peres french rivière des pères river of the fathers

in 1763  pierre laclède  his 13yearold stepson  auguste chouteau  and a small band of men traveled up the mississippi from  new orleans  to found a post to take advantage of trade coming downstream by the  missouri river   in november they landed a few miles downstream of the rivers confluence with the missouri river at a site where wooded limestone bluffs rose forty feet above the river  the men returned to fort de chartres for the winter but in  february  laclede sent chouteau and thirty men to begin construction laid out in a grid pattern as an imitation of new orleans  st louis was a river city and it therefore developed in response to its relationship to the river  development particularly economic development clustered around the settlements  mississippi river  bank on what was called the levee and is now called the landing  this long smooth bank of land which would later be paved with cobblestone sloped into the river at an incline that was gradual enough to permit the river vessels of the time to beach onto it in order to be unloaded and loaded  all products at this time were shipped to and from new orleans orienting st louis 18thcentury trade northsouth

the settlement began to grow quickly after word arrived that the 1763  treaty of paris  had given britain all the land east of the mississippi  frenchmen who had settled to the rivers east moved across the water to lacledes village  other early settlements were established nearby at  saint charles  the independent village of carondelet later annexed by st louis and now the southernmost part of the current city fleurissant renamed saint ferdinand by the  spaniards  and now  florissant  and  portage des sioux   in 1765 st louis was made the capital of upper louisiana

from 1766 to 1768 st louis was governed by the  french  lieutenant governor louis saint ange de bellerive who was not appointed by french or spanish authorities but by the leading residents of st louis  after 1768 st louis was governed by a  series of governors appointed by spanish authorities  whose administration continued even after louisiana was secretly returned to france in  1800  by the  treaty of san ildefonso   the towns population was then about a thousand  during the period when commandants appointed by spanish authorities governed st louis meetings of leading residents were also held from time to time and syndics were sometimes elected to carry out certain governmental tasks



st louis was acquired from france by the  united states  under  president   thomas jefferson  in  1803  as part of the  louisiana purchase   the transfer of power from spain was made official in a ceremony called three flags day  on  march 8   1804  the spanish flag was lowered and the french one raised  on  march 10  the french flag was replaced by the united states flag  french continued along with english to be one of the major spoken and written languages in st louis until the 1820s

st louis first became legally incorporated as a town on  november 9   1809  though it elected its first municipal legislators called trustees in  1808

the  lewis and clark expedition  left the st louis area in  may   1804  reached the  pacific ocean  in the summer of 1805 and returned on  23 september   1806   both lewis and clark lived in st louis after the expedition  many other  explorers   settlers  and  trappers  such as  ashleys hundred  would later take a similar route to the  west   missouri became a state in 1820  st louis was incorporated as a city on  december 9   1822   a u s arsenal was constructed at st louis in 1827

the steamboat era began in st louis on  july 27   1817  with the arrival of the zebulon m pike  steamboats signified significant progress in river trade as steam power permitted much more efficient and dependable river transportation unlike the handpropelled barges and keel boats that preceded the steamboat as the choice vehicle of mississippi river trade steamboats could travel upriver and against the current just as easily as downriver rapids north of the city made st louis the northernmost navigable port for many large boats and  pike  and her sisters soon transformed st louis into a bustling boom town commercial center and inland port  by the 1830s it was common to see over 150 steamboats at the st louis levee at one time and by the 1850s st louis had become the largest u s city west of pittsburgh and the secondlargest port in the country with a commercial tonnage exceeded only by  new york
