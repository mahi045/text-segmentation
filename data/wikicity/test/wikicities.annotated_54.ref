the old city of damascus enclosed by the city walls lies on the south bank of the river  barada  to the southeast north and northeast it is surrounded by suburban areas whose history stretches back to the middle ages  midan  in the southwest  sarouja  and  imara  in the north and northwest these districts originally arose on roads leading out of the city near the tombs of religious figures in the nineteenth century outlying villages developed on the slopes of  jabal qasioun  overlooking the city already the site of the  salihiyye  district centred around the important shrine of sheikh  muhi aldin ibn arabi  these new districts were initially settled by kurdish soldiery and muslim refugees from the european regions of the ottoman empire which had fallen under christian rule thus they were known as alakrad the kurds and  almuhajirin  the migrants they lay two to three kilometres north of the old city
========
from the late nineteenth century on a modern administrative and commercial centre began to spring up to the west of the old city around the barada centred on the area known as almerjeh or the meadow almerjeh soon became the name of what was initially the central square of modern damascus with the city hall on it the courts of justice post office and railway station stood on higher ground slightly to the south a europeanised residential quarter soon began to be built on the road leading between almerjeh and  salihiyye  the commercial and administrative centre of the new city gradually shifted northwards slightly towards this area
========
in the twentieth century newer suburbs developed north of the barada and to some extent to the south invading the ghouta oasis from 1955 the new district of  yarmouk  became a second home to thousands of palestinian refugees city planners preferred to preserve the ghouta as far as possible and in the later twentieth century some of the main areas of development were to the north in the western mezze district and most recently along the barada valley in dumar in the northwest and on the slopes of the mountains at berze in the northeast poorer areas often built without official approval have mostly developed south of the main city

excavations at tell ramad on the outskirts of the city have demonstrated that damascus has been inhabited as early as 8000 to 10000 bc  it is due to this that damascus is considered to be among the oldest continually inhabited cities in the world  however damascus is not documented as an important city until the coming of the  aramaeans  semitic nomads who arrived from the  arabian peninsula   it is known that it was the aramaeans who first established the water distribution system of damascus by constructing canals and tunnels which maximized the efficiency of the barada river  the same network was later improved by the romans and the umayyads and still forms the basis of the water system of the old part of damascus today it was mentioned in  genesis  14 as existing at the time of the  war of the kings
