havana     pronounced     is the  capital city  major port and leading commercial center of  cuba  the city under the name ciudad de la habana city of havana province is one of the 14  cuban provinces   the province has 23 million inhabitants and the metropolitan area over 3 million making havana the largest city in both cuba and the  caribbean region  and the ninthlargest in  latin america  the province is both the smallest and the most populous in cuba it is located about    southwest of  key west florida  on the northwest coast of cuba facing the  straits of florida  and is surrounded by  havana province  distinct from ciudad de la habana province and the coast
========
havana founded in 1515 is one of the  oldest cities founded by europeans  in the  western hemisphere   the city was protected by walls and fortificaions as it was often attacked by  pirates  and french  corsairs  its economy first developed on the basis of its location which made it one of the early great trade centres in the  new world  by far is the leading cultural centre of the island offers a wide variety of features that range from museums palaces public squares avenues churches and fortresses including the largest fortified complex in the americas dating from the 16th through 18th centuries the sinking of the  us battleship maine  in havanas harbor in 1898 was the immediate cause of the  spanishamerican war
========
havana is the center of the  cuban government  and various ministries and headquarters of businesses are based there much of cubas industrial and service economy is based in havana
========
 unlocode  cu hav  la habana was founded and formerly named as villa de san cristóbal de la habana by  diego velásquez de cuellar  the name habana is probably based upon the name of a local  taíno  chief  habaguanex  an alternate theory is that habana is derived from the  middle dutch  word havene referring to a  port  but as havana was not originally founded as a port this origin appears improbable
========
ciudad de la habana meaning city of havana is considered a province despite its name in common usage la habana is translated when in reference to the city havana in dutch english and portuguese la havane in french lavana in italian havanna in german but not when in reference to either of the provinces

the current havana area and its natural bay were first visited by europeans during  sebastián de ocampo s circumnavigation of the island in 1509 shortly thereafter in 1510 the first spanish  colonists  arrived from  hispaniola  and began the conquest of cuba
========
 conquistador   diego velázquez de cuéllar  founded havana on  august 25   1515  on the southern coast of the island near the present town of  surgidero de batabanó  between 1514 and 1519 the city had at least two different establishments  all attempts to found a city on cubas south coast failed the citys location was adjacent to a superb harbor at the entrance to the gulf of mexico and with easy access to the gulf stream the main ocean current that navigators followed when traveling from the  americas  to europe this location led to havanas early development as the principal port of spains  new world  colonies an early map of cuba drawn in 1514 places the town at the mouth of the river onicaxinal also on the south coast of cuba another establishment was la chorrera today in the neighbourhood of  puentes grandes  next to the  almendares river
========
the final establishment commemorated by  el templete  was the sixth town founded by the spanish on the island called san cristobal de la habana by  pánfilo de narváez  the name combines san cristóbal  patron saint  of havana and habana of obscure origin possibly derived from habaguanex an indian chief who controlled that area as mentioned by diego velasquez in his report to the king of spain a legend relates that habana was the name of habaguanexs beautiful daughter but no known historical source corroborates this version

havana moved to its current location next to what was then called puerto de carenas literally  careening  bay in 1519 the quality of this natural bay which now hosts havanas harbor warranted this change of location  bartolomé de las casas  wrote
========

one of the ships or both had the need of careening which is to renew or mend the parts that travel under the water and to put tar and wax in them and entered the port we now call havana and there they careened so the port was called de carenas this bay is very good and can host many ships which i visited few years after the discovery few are in spain or elsewhere in the world that are their equal
========
shortly after the founding of cubas first cities the island served as little more than a base for the conquista of other lands  hernán cortés  organized his expedition to  mexico  from here cuba during the first years of the discovery provided no immediate wealth to the  conquistadores  as it was poor in  gold   silver  and  precious stones  and many of its settlers moved to the more promising lands of mexico and south america that were being discovered and colonized at the time the legends of  eldorado  and the  seven cities of gold  attracted many adventurers from spain and also from the adjacent colonies leaving havana and the rest of cuba largely unpopulated
========
havana was originally a trading port and suffered regular attacks by  buccaneers   pirates  and french  corsairs  the first attack and resultant burning of the city was by the french corsair  jacques de sores  in 1555 the pirate took havana easily plundering the city and burning much of it to the ground de sores left without obtaining the enormous wealth he was hoping to find in havana  such attacks convinced the spanish crown to fund the construction of the first fortresses in the main cities mdash not only to counteract the pirates and corsairs but also to exert more control over commerce with the west indies and to limit the extensive contrabando  black market  that had arisen due to the trade restrictions imposed by the  casa de contratación  of  seville  the crowncontrolled trading house that held a  monopoly  on new world trade  to counteract pirate attacks on  galleon  convoys headed for spain while loaded with new world treasures the spanish crown decided to protect its ships by concentrating them in one large fleet that would traverse the atlantic ocean as a group a single merchant fleet could more easily be protected by the spanish  armada  following a royal decree in 1561 all ships headed for spain were required to assemble this fleet in the havana bay ships arrived from may through august waiting for the best weather conditions and together the fleet departed havana for spain by september
========
this naturally boosted commerce and development of the adjacent city of havana a humble villa at the time goods traded in havana included  gold   silver   alpaca   wool  from the  andes   emeralds  from  colombia   mahoganies  from cuba and  guatemala  leather from the  guajira   spices  sticks of  dye  from  campeche   corn   manioc  and  cocoa  ships from all over the new world carried products first to havana in order to be taken by the fleet to spain the thousands of ships gathered in the citys bay also fueled havanas agriculture and manufacture since they had to be supplied with food water and other products needed to traverse the ocean  in 1563 the capitán general the spanish governor of the island moved his residence from santiago de cuba to havana by reason of that citys newly gained wealth and importance thus unofficially sanctioning its status as capital of the island on  december 20   1592  king  philip ii of spain  granted havana the title of city later on the city would be officially designated as key to the new world and antemural of the west indies by the spanish crown  in the meantime efforts to build or improve the defensive infrastructures of the city continued the  san salvador de la punta  castle guarded the west entrance of the bay while the  castillo de los tres reyes magos del morro  guarded the eastern entrance the  castillo de la real fuerza  defended the citys center and doubled as the governors residence until a more comfortable palace was built two other defensive towers la chorrera and  san lázaro  were also built in this period
========
havana expanded greatly in the 17th century new buildings were constructed from the most abundant materials of the island mainly  wood  combining various  iberian  architectural styles as well as borrowing profusely from  canarian  characteristics during this period the city also built civic monuments and religious constructions the convent of st augustin el morro castle the chapel of the humilladero the fountain of dorotea de la luna in la chorrera the church of the holy angel the hospital of san lazaro the monastery of santa teresa and the convent of san felipe neri were all completed in this era
========
in 1649 a fatal epidemic brought from  cartagena  in  colombia  affected a third of the population of havana on  november 30   1665  queen  mariana of austria  widow of king  philip iv of spain  ratified the heraldic shield of cuba which took as its symbolic motifs the first three castles of havana the real fuerza the tres santos reyes magos del morro and san salvador de la punta the shield also displayed a symbolic golden key to represent the title key to the gulf on 1674 the works for the city walls were started as part of the fortification efforts they would be completed on 1740
========
by the middle of the 18th century havana had more than seventy thousand inhabitants and was the third largest city in the americas ranking behind  lima  and  mexico city  but ahead of  boston  and  new york  the prosperity of havana brought continued international attention and the city was unexpectedly seized by the  royal navy  the episode began on  june 6   1762  when at dawn an impressive british fleet containing more than 50 ships and 14000 men sailed into cuban waters by august the british had havana under  siege   the city was subsequently governed by sir  george keppel  on behalf of  great britain   the british seized the city as part of the  seven years war  they immediately opened up trade with their north american and caribbean colonies causing a rapid transformation of cuban society food horses and other goods flooded into the city and thousands of slaves from west africa were transported to the island to work on the under manned sugar plantations
========
after regaining the city the spanish transformed havana into the most heavily fortified city in the americas construction began on what was to become the fortress of san carlos de la cabaña the biggest spanish fortification in the new world the work extended for eleven years and was enormously costly but on completion the fort was considered an unassailable bastion and essential to havanas defence it was provided with a large number of cannons forged in  barcelona  other fortifications were constructed as well the castle of atarés defended the  shipyard  in the inner bay while the castle of el príncipe guarded the city from the west several cannon batteries located along the bays  canal  among them the san nazario and doce apóstoles batteries ensured that no place in the harbor remained undefended
