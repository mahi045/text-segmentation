contemporary havana can essentially be described as three cities in one  old havana   vedado  and the newer suburban districts old havana with its narrow streets and overhanging balconies is the traditional centre of part of havanas commerce industry and entertainment as well as being a residential area
========
to the north and west a newer section centred on the uptown area known as  vedado  has become the rival of old havana for commercial activity and nightlife  centro habana  sometimes described as part of vedado is mainly a shopping district that lies between vedado and old havana the  capitolio nacional  marks the beginning of centro habana a working class neighborhood where a lot of buildings are almost in a total state of collapse   chinatown and the  real fabrica de tabacos partagás  one of cubas oldest cigar factories is located in the area
========
a third havana is that of the more affluent residential and industrial districts that spread out mostly to the west among these is  marianao  one of the newer parts of the city dating mainly from the 1920s some of the suburban exclusivity was lost after the revolution many of the suburban homes having been nationalized by the cuban government to serve as schools hospitals and government offices several private country clubs were converted to public recreational centres
 miramar  located west of vedado along the coast remains havanas exclusive area mansions foreign embassies diplomatic residences upscale shops and facilities for wealthy foreigners are common in the area the  international school of havana  is located in the  miramar  neighborhood

neoclassical


havana is unique due to its unrivalled rhythmic arcades built largely by spanish immigrants many interior patios remain similar to designs in  seville   cadiz  and  granada    neoclassicism  affected all new buildings in havana and can be seen all over the city many urban features were introduced into the city at the time including gas public lighting in 1848 and the railroad in 1837 in the second half of the 18th century sugar and coffee production increased rapidly becoming essential in the development of havanas most prominent architectural style many wealthy habaneros took their inspiration from the  french  this can be seen within the interiors of upper class houses such as the aldama palace built in 1844 this is considered the most important neoclassical residential building in cuba and typifies the design of many houses of this period with portales of neoclassical columns facing open spaces or courtyards
========
in 1925  jeanclaude nicolas forestier  the head of urban planning in paris moved to havana for five years to collaborate with architects and landscape designers in the master planning of the city his aim was to create a harmonic balance between the classical built form and the tropical landscape he embraced and connected the citys road networks while accentuating prominent landmarks his influence has left a huge mark on havana although many of his ideas were cut short by the great depression in 1929  during the first decades of the 20th century havana expanded more rapidly than at any time during its history great wealth prompted architectural styles to be influenced from abroad  the peak of neoclassicism came with the construction of the vedado district begun in1859 this whole neighbourhood is littered with set back wellproportioned buildings
========
colonial and baroque


great riches were brought from the colonialists into and through havana as it was a key  transshipment  point between the  new world  and  old world  as a result havana was the most heavily fortified city in the americas  most examples of early architecture can be seen in military fortifications such as la fortaleza de san carlos de la cabana 1558  1577 designed by juan antonelli and the  castillo del morro  1589  1630 this sits at the entrance of havana bay and provides an insight into the supremacy and wealth at that time old havana was also protected by a defensive wall begun in 1674 but had already overgrown its boundaries when it was completed in 1767 becoming the new neighbourhood of  centro habana
========
the influence from different styles and cultures can be seen in havanas colonial architecture with a diverse range of  moorish  spanish  italian   greek  and  roman  the convento de santa clara 1638  18th century is a good example of early spanish influenced architecture its great hall looks resembles an inverted ship and shows the skill of early craftsmen
