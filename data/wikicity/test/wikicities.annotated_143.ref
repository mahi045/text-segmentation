according to  legend  the city of rome was founded by the  twins   romulus and remus  on  april 21   753 bc  and archaeological evidence supports the theory that rome grew from  pastoral  settlements on the  palatine hill  built in the area of the future  roman forum  coalescing into a city in the  8th century bc  the city developed into the  capital  of the  roman kingdom  ruled by a succession of  seven   kings  according to tradition  roman republic  from 510 bc governed by the  senate  but finally the  roman empire  from 27 bc ruled by an  emperor  this success depended on military conquest commercial predominance as well as selective assimilation of neighboring civilizations most notably the  etruscans  and  greeks   from the foundation of rome in 753 bc the city of rome was undefeated militarily though losing occasional battles until 386 bc when rome was occupied by  celts  one of the three main gallic tribes and then recovered by romans in the same year livy book 5 according to the history the gauls offered to deliver rome back to its people for a thousand pounds of gold but the romans refused preferring to take back their city by force of arms rather than ever admitting defeat

roman dominance expanded over most of  europe  and the shores of the  mediterranean sea  while its  population  surpassed one million inhabitants for almost a thousand years rome was the most politically important richest and largest city in the  western world  and remained so after the empire started to  decline  and was split even if it ultimately lost its capital status to  milan  and then  ravenna  and was surpassed in prestige by the  eastern  capital  constantinople

========
with the reign of  constantine i  the  bishop of rome  gained political as well as religious importance eventually becoming known as the  pope  and establishing rome as the centre of the catholic church after the  sack of rome 410  by  alaric i  and the  fall of the western roman empire  in  476  ad rome alternated between  byzantine  and plundering by  germanic barbarians  its population declined to a mere 20000 during the  early middle ages  reducing the sprawling city to groups of inhabited buildings interspersed among large areas of ruins and vegetation rome remained nominally part of the  byzantine empire  rule until  751  ad when the  lombards  finally abolished the  exarchate of ravenna  in  756   pepin the short  gave the pope temporal jurisdiction over rome and surrounding areas thus creating the  papal states
rome remained the capital of the  papal states  until its annexation into the  kingdom of italy  in  1870  the city became a major  pilgrimage  site during the  middle ages  and the focus of struggles between the  papacy  and the  holy roman empire  starting with  charlemagne  who was crowned its first emperor in rome on  christmas  800 ad by  pope leo iii  apart from brief periods as an independent city during the  middle ages  rome kept its status of papal capital and holy city for centuries even when the pope briefly relocated to  avignon  13091337 while no longer politically powerful as tragically shown by the brutal  sack of 1527  the city flourished as a hub of cultural and artistic activity during the  renaissance  and the  baroque  under the patronage of the  papal court

========
 population  rose again and reached 100000 during the  17th century  but rome ultimately lagged behind the rest of the european capitals over the subsequent centuries being largely busy in the  counterreformation  process
caught up in the  nationalistic  turmoils of the  19th century  and having twice gained and lost a shortlived independence rome became the focus of the hopes for italian unification as propelled by the  kingdom of italy  ruled by king  vittorio emanuele ii  after the  french  protection was lifted in  1870  royal troops stormed the city and rome was declared capital of the newly unified italy in  1871
========
after a victorious  world war i  rome witnessed the rise to power of  italian fascism  guided by  benito mussolini  who  marched  on the city in  1922  eventually declared a new  empire  and allied  italy  with  nazi germany  this was a period of rapid growth in population from the 212000 people at the time of unification to more than 1000000 but this trend was halted by  world war ii  during which rome was damaged by both  allied forces   bombing  and nazi occupation after the execution of  mussolini  and the end of the war a  1946 referendum  abolished the monarchy in favor of the  italian republic
rome grew momentously after the war as one of the driving forces behind the italian economic miracle of postwar  reconstruction  and  modernization  it became a  fashionable  city in the 1950s and early 1960s the years of  la dolce vita  the sweet life and a new rising trend in population continued till the mid1980s when the comune had more than 2800000 residents after that population started to slowly decline as more residents moved to nearby comuni this has been attributed to their perceiving a decrease in the quality of life   especially because of the continuously  jammed traffic  and the worsening  pollution  it brings about
in recent years the trend has changed again and the population is increasing again thanks also to the cultural and economic dynamism of the city and immigration from many different countries
