vancouvers view protection guidelines were approved in 1989 and amended in 1990 establishing view corridors in the downtown with height limits to protect views of the  north shore mountains  these guidelines have succeeded in preserving mountain views although some find vancouvers skyline flat and lacking in visual interest many agree that there is a need for some taller buildings to reflect vancouvers contemporary image but others are concerned about proposals for much higher buildings many believe that the natural setting and in particular views of the north shore mountains may be hindered as tall buildings grow in number in response to these concerns  council  commissioned a skyline study in 1997
========
the skyline study concluded that vancouvers skyline would benefit from the addition of a handful of buildings exceeding current height limits to add visual interest to vancouvers skyline this led to the general policy on higher buildings the study noted that the opportunities for such buildings were restricted due to a limited number of large development sites in the downtown there were at least five sites identified where buildings exceeding the 137nbspmetres 450nbspft height limit are possible and at least two sites in the northwest corner of the central business district where heights up to 122nbspmetres 400nbspft exceeding the 91nbspmetre300nbspfoot limit might be considered eight years later five of the seven identified sites for higher buildings have been developed or are in the development application process the tallest of these new buildings is the  living shangrila  hotelresidential tower which when completed in 2009 will stand 197nbspmeters 646nbspft tall 61 storeys
