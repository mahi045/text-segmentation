rome became the preeminent  christian  city visavis  antioch  and  alexandria  and later  constantinople  and  jerusalem  based on the tradition that  saint peter  and  saint paul  were  martyred  in the city during the 1st century coupled with the citys political importance the  bishop of rome  later known as the  pope  claimed primacy over all bishops and therefore all christians on the basis that he is the successor of  saint peter  upon whom  jesus  built his church his prestige had been enhanced since  313  through donations by roman emperors and patricians including the  lateran palace  and patriarchal basilicas as well as the obviously growing influence of the church over the failing civil imperial authority papal authority has been exercised over the centuries with varying degrees of success at times triggering divisions among christians until the present

with the increasing chaos and disorder leading to the collapse of the roman empire in  476  the popes assumed more and more civil authority first in rome and in the surrounding territories rome became the center of the  catholic church  and the  capital city  of the  papal states  consequently a great number of churches convents and other religious buildings were erected in the city sometimes above the ruins of older prechristian sites of worship  churches proliferated  during the renaissance when the romes most notable churches were built this includes  st peters   basilica  on the  vatican hill  the largest church in the world and the city  cathedral  of  st john  at the  lateran  the  papacy  established its residence first in the  lateran palace  then in the  quirinal palace  when rome was annexed by force to the newly unified  kingdom of italy  in  1870   pope pius ix  retired to the  vatican  proclaiming himself a prisoner of the  savoy monarchy  and leading to decades of conflict between the neonate state and the catholic church this was resolved in  1929  when the  lateran treaty  were signed in rome establishing the right for the  holy see  to govern the  vatican city  as an independent  sovereign state  the  patron saints  of rome remain  saint peter  and  saint paul  or as they are collectively referred to in this context the most holy saints peter and paul both celebrated on  june 29

the original language of rome was  latin  which evolved during the  middle ages  into  italian  the latter emerged as the confluence of various regional dialects among which the  tuscan dialect  predominated but the population of rome also developed its own dialect the  romanesco  the ancient romanesco used during the  middle ages  was a southern italian dialect very close to the  neapolitan  the influence of the  florentine  culture during the  renaissance  and above all the immigration to rome of many florentines who were among the two  medici  popes  leo x  and  clement vii  suite caused a strong change of the dialect which became much closer to the tuscan varieties the immigration of florentines was mainly due to the  sack of rome in 1527  and the subsequent demographic decrease this remained largely confined to rome until the  19th century  but then expanded other zones of  lazio   civitavecchia   latina  from the beginning of the  20th century  thanks to the rising population of rome and to better transportation systems as a consequence  romanesco  abandoned its traditional forms to  mutate  into the dialect spoken within the city which is more similar to standard  italian  although remaining distinct from other romanescoinfluenced local dialects of lazio  dialectal  literature in the traditional form  romanesco  includes the works of such authors as  giuseppe gioacchino belli   trilussa  and  cesare pascarella  contemporary  romanesco  is mainly represented by popular actors such as  aldo fabrizi   alberto sordi   nino manfredi   anna magnani   gigi proietti   enrico montesano  and  carlo verdone
