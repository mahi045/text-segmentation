the centre of cologne was completely destroyed during world war ii the reconstruction of the city followed the style of the 1950s while respecting the old layout and naming of the streets thus the city today is characterised by simple and modest postwar buildings with few interspersed prewar buildings which were reconstructed due to their historical importance some buildings of the wiederaufbauzeit era of reconstruction for example the opera house by  wilhelm riphahn  are nowadays regarded as classics in modern architecture nevertheless the uncompromising style of the opera house and other modern buildings has remained controversial
