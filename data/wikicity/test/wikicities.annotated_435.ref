the population of caracas is of 5452320 2007 inhabitants not including the surrounding suburbs like petare whose population is approximately 1500000 people
========
the mixture of races and cultures has marked this city throughout its history previously during colonial times spaniards mixed with local native indians and again with  african slaves  brought to work on the cocoa and coffee fields as a result the racial and ethnic composition of caracas is diverse
========
after independence and following the discovery and exploitation of petroleum european immigrants began to arrive in the growing city examples include the french who brought the telephone system thus locals answer the phone in french style saying aló and the dutch  shell petroleum  who came to exploit the natural resources
========
the aftermath of  the second world war  repressive european dictatorships and the continued exploitation of petroleum attracted many thousands of immigrants from spain  galicia   canary islands  especially portugal  madeira island  especially and italy middle eastern immigrants from  palestine  and  lebanon  also sought a new life in the cityeuropean immigration was notorious during the 1960s and 1970s but the 1980s and 1990s saw growing numbers of immigrants hailing from neighboring countries such as  colombia  ecuador peru bolivia  trinidad and tobago  and haiti
========
due to the old spanish influence mixture of races and cultures has been an accepted part of life in the city of caracas therefore it is not difficult to find blond people with dark eyes as well as very dark people with blondish hair and  blue eyes  nevertheless the common demography would be  mulatos  people of mixed black and white ancestry  mestizos  mixed white and native indian and  criollos  an amalgamation of three races
========
many newcomers from the countryside have arrived but unfortunately the city has grown haphazardly no demographic planning has ever been carried out thus there are entire districts and neighborhoods of caracas lacking water and electrical systems not to mention other services like schools hospitals police  fire departments  etc therefore some suburbs and districts of the city are like lawless territories in which insecurity is felt at all times caracas like many other latin american cities represents the best example of nonplanned supportable development where a modern progressive city coexists with lawlessness and poverty

 skyscrapers  may loom overhead but theres more than a hint of original colonial flavor in this neatly proportioned reconstruction of the house where  simón bolívar  was born on  july 24   1783  the  museum s exhibits include period  weapons   banners  and  uniforms

much of the original colonial interior has been replaced by monumental paintings of battle scenes but more personal  relics  can be seen in the nearby  museo bolivariano  pride of place goes to the coffin in which bolívars remains were brought from  colombia  his ashes now rest in the  national pantheon
========
bolívars funeral was held 12 years after his death at the  iglesia de san francisco  just a few blocks west and it was also here that he was proclaimed  el libertador  in 1813 the church dazzles the eye with its richly gilded  baroque  altarpieces and still retains much of its original colonial interior despite being given a modernizing onceover by guzmán blanco
========
the gardens that surround this museum are almost as enticing as its interior the museum is housed in a gorgeous colonial country mansion known as  quinta anauco  which is surrounded by beautiful greenery inside the house youll find meticulously restored rooms filled with carefully selected works of art furniture and period household and many other historical artifacts
========
the quinta was well outside the historic town when it was built back in 1797 but today its an  oasis  in the inner suburb of  san bernardino  head there late on a sunday morning and you might catch a  chamber music  concert in rooms which were once the house stables
