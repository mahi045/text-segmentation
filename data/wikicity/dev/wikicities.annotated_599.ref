then came  yellow fever  borne by mosquitos from the surrounding swampland tampa was hit by wave after wave of yellow fever epidemics and scares throughout the late 1860s and 1870s the disease was little understood at the time and many residents simply packed up and left rather than face the mysterious and deadly peril
========
a telling moment occurred in 1869 when residents voted to abolish the city of tampa government  the population of tampa town was below 800 in the official 1870 census count and had fallen further by 1880 see demographics below the little village was dying
========
another blow was to come fort brooke the seed from which tampa had germinated had served its purpose and was decommissioned in 1883 except for two  cannons  displayed on the nearby  university of tampa  campus all traces of the fort are gone in an odd nod to history a large downtown parking garage near the old fort site is called the fort brooke parking garage
========
then out of the blue tampas fortunes took several sudden turns for the better first  phosphate  was discovered in the  bone valley  region southeast of tampa in 1883 the mineral which is vital for the production of fertilizers and other products was soon being shipped out from the port of tampa in ever increasing volume tampa is still one of the worlds leading phosphate exporters

 henry b plant s railroad line reached tampa and its port shortly thereafter connecting the small town to the countrys railroad system tampa finally had the overland transportation link that had been so sorely lacking the railroad enabled phosphate and  commercial fishing  exports to go north  brought many new products into the tampa market and started the first real tourist industry visitors coming in modest numbers to henry plants first tampaarea resort built literally on tampa bay on stilts this was not the stillstanding tampa bay hotel which came a few years later
========
the new railroad link enabled another important industry to come to tampa in 1885 the tampa board of trade helped broker a land deal with  vicente martinez ybor  to move his  cigar  manufacturing operations to tampa from  key west  close proximity to cuba made imports of tobacco easy by sea and plants railroad made shipment of finished cigars to the rest of the us market easy by land
========
since tampa was still a small town at the time population less than 5000 ybor built hundreds of small houses around his factory to accommodate the immediate influx of mainly  cuban  and  spanish  cigar workers other cigar factories soon moved in and  ybor city  as the 40odd acre settlement was dubbed quickly made tampa a major cigar production center to round out the towns population many  italian  and a few eastern european  jewish  immigrants also arrived starting in the late 1880s mainly operating businesses and shops that catered to the cigar workers the majority of italian immigrants came from  alessandria della rocca  and  santo stefano quisquina  two small  sicilian  towns with which tampa still maintains strong ties
========


in 1891  henry b plant  built a lavish 500 room quartermile long luxury resort hotel called the  tampa bay hotel  among 150 acres of manicured gardens along the banks  hillsborough river  the eclectic structure cost 25 million to build a huge sum in those days plant filled his expensive playground with exotic art collectables from around the world and installed electric lights and the first elevator in town
========
the resort did great business for a few years especially during the  spanishamerican war  see below but with plants death in 1899 the hotels fortunes began to fade it closed in 1930 in 1933 however the stately building reopened as the  university of tampa
========
mainly because of henry plants connections in the war department tampa was chosen as an embarkation center for american troops in the  spanishamerican war  lieutenant colonel  teddy roosevelt  and his  rough riders  were among the 30000 troops who waited in tampa for the order to ship out to cuba during the summer of 1898 filling the town to bursting  those months while unpleasant for the troops wearing thick wool uniforms in the oppressive florida heat were a great boon to tampas growing economy it was also the only time when plants tampa bay hotel was full to capacity
========
the founding of ybor city the building of plants railroad and hotels and the discovery of phosphate  all within a dozen years in the late 1800s  were crucial to tampas development the town suddenly expanded from sleepy backwater village to bustling town to small city except for temporary bumps along the way this growth has continued unabatted
========
during the first few decades of the 20th century the cigar making industry continued to be the backbone of tampas economy the factories in  ybor city  and west tampa made an enormous number of cigars  in the peak year of 1929 over 500000000 cigars were hand rolled in the city as the market for cigars began to wane during the great depression other industries came to the fore especially shipping and of course tourism
========
in 1904 a local civic association of local businessmen dubbed themselves  ye mystic krewe of gasparilla  named after local mythical pirate jose gaspar and staged an invasion of the city followed by a parade with a few exceptions the  gasparilla pirate festival  has been held every year since
========
beginning in the late 1800s illegal  bolita  lotteries were very popular among the tampa working classes especially in ybor city in the early 1920s this smalltime operation was taken over by charlie wall the rebellious son of a prominent tampa family and went bigtime bolita was able to openly thrive only because of kickbacks and bribes to key local politicians and law enforcement officials and many were on the take
========
profits from the bolita lotteries and  prohibition era bootlegging led to the development of several  organized crime  factions in the city charlie wall was the first major boss but various power struggles culminated in consolidation of control by  sicilian   mafioso   santo trafficante sr  and his faction in the 1950s after his death in 1954 from  cancer  control passed to his son  santo trafficante jr  who established alliances with families in  new york  and extended his power throughout  florida  and into  batista era  cuba
========
the era of rampant and open corruption ended in the 1950s when the  senator kefauver s traveling  organized crime hearings  came to town and were followed by the sensational misconduct trials of several local officials though many of the worse offenders in government and the mob were not charged the trials helped to end the sense of lawlessness which had prevailed in tampa for decades
========
the  university of south florida  was established in 1956 sparking development in northern tampa and nearby  temple terrace
========
there were four attempts to consolidate tampa with hillsborough county 1967 1970 1971 and 1972 all of which failed at the ballot box with the biggest margin was 33160 for and 73568 against the proposed charter in 1972
========
the biggest recent growth in the city was the development of  new tampa  that started in 1988 when the city annexed a 24square mile mostly rural area between  i275  and  i75  since then many subdivisions and thousands of homes and businesses have filled in accounting for much of tampas population growth over that time
========
east tampa which has historically been a mostly black community was the scene of several  riots  mainly due to problems between residents and the tampa  police
