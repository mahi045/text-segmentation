moving around in a car can be difficult in and around the city centre because of the many oneway streets and frequent traffic jams this makes the public transportation system more attractive if one wants to go there the trinary system allows quick access to the city centre for car drivers some avenues are spacious and laid out in a grid and apart from some points around the city centre munhoz da rocha street and batel avenue traffic jams arent thus severe
========
recently the city installed around 200  traffic radars  causing much discontent among drivers in general this technology uses sensors under the pavement which trigger a  digital camera  if the car is above speed limit the picture including the date and time it was taken is sent to the drivers home as a  speeding ticket  the system can send these tickets to drivers anywhere in  brazil
