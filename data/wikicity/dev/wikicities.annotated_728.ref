========
the major terminal was recently dec07 destroyed by fire so conditions at the airport will be somewhat chaotic and may hasten the building of the new terminal
========
it is strongly recommended to have your ground transportation arranged in advance if you are staying in a local hotel this will help deal with getting your bags off the belt and not have to deal with the local taxi drivers who are not aggressive but can grab your suitcase and throw into the back of their cab if you are not quick
========
taxis in medan do not run on a meter each fare is negotiated prior to departure and is subject to renegotiation mid journey it is highly recommended that you have the hotel staff negotiate for you and dont fall for any sad story on the way the taxis are also generally in very bad repair including the so called flagship companies that operate it is only slightly more expensive to use the cars from the hotel and if you are likely to go to three or four places in a day just hire the car and driver for the day you can communicate by sms
========
one of the unique features of medan are the motorized  becaks  that are found almost everywhere unlike traditional  becaks  a motorized becak can take its passenger anywhere in the city there are also more common transport like taxis and minibuses known as sudako
========
the becak mentioned above is certainly a novel and unique way to get around medan they are quick and relatively cheap average fare should be no more than rp10000 us100 but again make sure that the fare is negotiated and agreed if you are seen to be a raw tourist your minimum fare is going to be rp50000 so then its better and cheaper to take a taxi
========
the becak is not comfortable and getting two western backsides into the narrow seat is not at all easy so look at them as a great thrill but not your normal mode of transport
========
railroad tracks connect medan to  binjai  and  tanjungpura  to the northwest to port of  belawan  to the north and to  tebing tinggi  and  pematang siantar  to the southeast
========
the seaport of  belawan  is about 20 km to the north  polonia international airport  is located in the heart of the city  kuala namu international airport  is a new airport under construction and is due to replace polonia in 2009
========
a toll highway connects medan to  belawan  and  tanjungmorawa  a plan for the extension of this highway to  tebing tinggi  and to  binjai  has been completed and the central government is currently seeking investors to build the extension
========
road rules are randomly obeyed in all of indonesia and in medan the major offenders are the young motorcyclists almost daily you will see one with his head split open on the road being shoveled into a becak for his last trip to the local hospital
========
the tvri medan stateowned and deli tv private are the only two local tv stations in medan several local newspapers are running in the city with harian analisa as the oldest one
========
