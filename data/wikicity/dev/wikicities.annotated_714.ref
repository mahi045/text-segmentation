the opening of the the taichung international airport did spark a spat of partisan controversy about being incomplete and safety concerns were raised the fact that taiwan has more airports per capita than any other country in the region and prohibits private airplanes fell on deaf ears because the anticipated and protracted opening of direct links with the chinese mainland are expected to require an increase in air traffic
