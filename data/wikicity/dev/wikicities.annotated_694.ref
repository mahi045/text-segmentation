the name santiago de cali comes in one part to honour  saint james  the apostle santiago in spanish whose feast day is celebrated on july 25 there are several possibilities of the origin of the word cali some attribute it to a mispronunciation of the word lili the name of a local tribe others believe that the word cali has  quechua  origin and it was brought by the  yanaconas indians  that came from  quito  serving  sebastián de belalcázar  this theory is reinforced by the fact that near quito there is an indigenous town named cali cali

before the arrival of the spaniards the current region of cali was inhabited by many indigenous tribes mostly speakers of  cariban languages  in the region between the  cauca river  and the western cordillera the  gorrones  were established between the present day  roldanillo  and cali the biggest morrons town was settled on the river pescador near the present day towns of  zarzal  and  bugalagrande  although  cannibals  the morrones traded with the  quimbayas  who inhabited the north of the  valle del cauca

the morrones gave up easily to the spaniards and were divided in  encomiendas  the already  mestizo  nature of the spaniards made the process of mixing with the  amerindians  easy in fact belalcázar himself had several children born in the americas from indian mothers as did his men
========
cali was important for belalcazar because it was beyond the  inca empire  after the capture and execution of the inca  atahualpa  at  cajamarca   francisco pizarro  had sent belalcazar to take possession of  guayaquil  and quito on his behalf cali being beyond the quechua empire was claimed by belalcazar as his own territory after his death his descendants maintained possession of much of the land until the  war of independence against spain
