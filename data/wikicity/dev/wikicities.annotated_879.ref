recently privately owned minibuses  marshrutkas  have appeared on kiev streets they provide good coverage of smaller residential streets and have convenient routes minibuses take fewer passengers run faster stop on demand and are more available although with an increased frequency of accidents ticket price and itinerary of private minibuses are regulated by the city government and the cost of one ride while higher than on public buses is still far lower than in western europe
========
the  taxi  market in kiev is expansive but not adequately regulated in particular the taxi fare per kilometer is not regulated there is strong competition between private taxi companies many allow scheduling a pickup by phone also it is quite common for a local with a car or even people from other parts of ukraine to provide taxi service on the ad hoc basis  traffic jams  and lack of parking space are growing problems for taxi services in kiev current regulations allow for parking on pavements which pedestrians may find inconvenient
========
suburban transportation is provided by buses and shortrange trains  elektrichkas  there are a few bus stations inside the city providing suburban transportations private minibuses marshrutkas provide faster and more frequent suburban service currently winning the competition against large buses
========
elektrichkas are serviced by the publicly owned  ukrzaliznytsia  company the suburban train service is fast and unbeatingly safe in terms of traffic accidents but the trains are not reliable as they may fail significantly behind schedule may not be safe in terms of crime and the elektrichka cars are poorly maintained and are overcrowded in  rush hours
========
there are 5 elektrichka directions from kiev
  nizhyn  northeastern
  hrebinka  southeastern
  myronivka  southern
  fastiv  southwestern
  korosten  western

 railways  are kievs main mode of intracity transportation the city has a developed railroad infrastructure including a longdistance passenger station 6 cargo stations depots and repairing facilities however this system still fails to meet the demand for passenger service particularly the  kiev passenger railway station  is the citys only longdistance passenger terminal vokzal construction is underway for a new  darnytsia railway station  on the leftbank part of kiev which may ease traffic at the central station  bridges over the dnieper river  are another problem restricting the development of citys railway system presently only one rail bridge out of two is available for intense train traffic a new combined railauto bridge is under construction as a part of darnytsia project
========
