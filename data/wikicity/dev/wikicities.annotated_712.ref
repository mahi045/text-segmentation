unlike other major cities taichung has no expressway crossing the city  the heaviest traffic congestion is on taichung harbor road 台中港路 which can come to a stand still not only during rush hour but also on weekends or late evenings as many of the most popular shopping centers and movie theaters are on that stretch of road  other busy stretches of road include sanmin road near chungyou department store and yizhong street especially around 900 pm when local cram schools and baseball games typically let out
========
the downtown area is vaguely a grid pattern with ziyou road 自由路 and sanmin 三民路 running basically southwest to northeast while zhongzheng road 中正路 and linsen road 林森路 run northwest from the center of the city in addition to the more narrow oneway roads that follow the grid pattern as well

stop lights and lane indicators are generally observed on major streets but are often viewed more as suggestions rather than legally enforced traffic rules unless traffic police officers are present speed limits are often not enforced except where specifically designated speed detection cameras are present and marked with signs making traffic conditions some of the most dangerous on the island  most major intersections have traffic signs with romanized names  however despite the fact that taichung city has recently declared hanyu pinyin the official romanization citiation needed system for the city there are numerous signs leftover from previous romanization regimes while the a large number of minor intersections have no romanization of any kind  navigation in taichung city is extremely difficult for those who are unable to read chinese characters
