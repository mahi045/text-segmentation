aleppo     ḥalab     is a city in northern  syria  capital of the  aleppo governorate  the city has a population of around 3780000 making it the second largest city in syria after  damascus  aleppo is one of the oldest inhabited cities in history it knew human settlement since the eleventh millennium bc through the residential houses which were discovered in alqaramel hill it was known to antiquity as khalpe khalibon to the  greeks  as beroea veroea and to the  turks  as halep during the french mandate alep was used it occupies a strategic trading point midway between the sea and the  euphrates  initially it was built on a small group of hills in a wide fertile valley on both sides of the river  quweiq  قويق the province or governorate extends around the city for over 16000 km and has around 41 million inhabitants
========
the main role of the city was as a trading place as it sat at the crossroads of two trade routes and mediated the trade from  india  the  tigris  and  euphrates  regions and the route coming from  damascus  in the south which traced the base of the mountains rather than the rugged seacoast  although trade was often directed away from the city for political reasons it continued to thrive until the europeans began to use the  cape route  to  india  and later to utilise the route through  egypt  to the  red sea  since then the city has declined and its chief exports now are the agricultural products of the surrounding region mainly  wheat  and  cotton   pistachios   olives  and  sheep
========
the name halab is of obscure origins some proposed that halab means the metals of iron or copper in amorite languages since it was a major source of these metals in antiquity halaba in aramaic means white referring to the color of soil and marble abundant in the area another proposed etymology is that the name halab means gave out milk coming from the ancient tradition that  abraham  gave milk to travelers as they moved throughout the region the colour of his cows was ashen arab shaheb therefore the city is also called halab ashshahba he milked the ashcoloured

because the modern city occupies its ancient site aleppo has scarcely been touched by archaeologists the site has been occupied from around  5000 bc  as excavations in tallet alsauda show it grew as the capital of the kingdom of  yamkhad  until the ruling  amorite  dynasty was overthrown around  1600 bc  the city remained under hittite control until perhaps  800 bc  before passing through the hands of the  assyrians  and the  persian empire  and being captured by the greeks in  333 bc  when  seleucus nicator  renamed the settlement beroea after  beroea  in  macedon  the city remained in greek or  seleucid  hands until  64 bc  when  syria  was conquered by the  romans
========
the city remained part of the  eastern roman or byzantine empire  before falling to  arabs  under  khalid ibn alwalid  in  637  in the  10th century  a resurgent byzantine empire briefly regained control from  974  to  987  and remained an imperial vassal until the  byzantinseljuk wars  the city was twice besieged by  crusaders in  1098  and in  1124 but was not conquered
========
on  august 9   1138   a deadly earthquake  ravaged the city and the surrounding area although estimates from this time are very unreliable it is believed that 230000 people died making it the  fourth deadliest  earthquake in recorded history
========
