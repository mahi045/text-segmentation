arriving into polonia international airport is an interesting experience your plane will almost always be parked as far away from the arrival hall regardless of whether its a domestic or international flight so you get to ride to the arrival area on a bus dont hurry to get on the bus as its a lifo situation last in first off the immigration officials are quite efficient on arrival not so efficiant on departure if you dont have a visa you can get one on arrival always take the left hand line at immigration but be prepared to be pushed aside for one of the many vips that populate airtravel communities in indonesia
