========


the ancient history of lucknow is believed to begin after the suryawanshi king lord rama ordered his younger brother lakshman to establish a town at the present site of lakshman tila lucknow was named lakshmanpuri or lakhanpuri or laknamau after him slowly the name lakhanpuri became lakhnau and then named lucknow by the british after 1350 ad the lucknow and parts of awadh region have been under the rule of the  delhi sultanate  the  mughal empire  the  nawabs of awadh  the  east india company  and the  british raj  lucknow has been one of the major centers of  first war of independence  participated actively in  indias independence movement  and after independence has emerged as an important city of  north india
========
until 1719  subah  of awadh was a province of the  mughal empire  administered by a governor appointed by the emperor  saadat khan  also called burhanulmulk a persian adventurer was appointed the nazim of  awadh  in 1722 and he established his court in faizabad  near lucknow
========
awadh was known as the granary of india and was important strategically for the control of the doab the fertile plain between the  ganga  and the  yamuna  rivers it was a wealthy kingdom able to maintain its independence against threats from the  marathas  the  british  and the  afghans  the third nawab  shujauddaula  fell out with the british after aiding  mir qasim  the fugitive  nawab of bengal  he was comprehensively defeated in the  battle of buxar  by the east india company after which he was forced to pay heavy penalties and cede parts of his territory the british appointed a resident in 1773 and over time gained control of more territory and authority in the state they were disinclined to capture awadh outright because that would bring them face to face with the marathas and the remnants of the mughal empire
========
lucknows rise to growth and fame begins with its elevation as capital of awadh by nawab  asafuddowlah  he was a great philanthropist and gave lucknow a unique and enduring legacy the architectural contributions of these awadh rulers include several imposing  monuments of the monuments standing today the  bara imambara  the  chhota imambara  and the  roomi darwaza  are notable examples one of the more lasting contributions by the nawabs is the  syncretic  composite culture that has come to be known as the gangajamuni tehzeeb
========
in 1798 the fifth nawab wazir ali khan alienated both his people and  the british and was forced to abdicate the british then helped  saadat ali khan  to the throne saadat ali khan was a puppet king who in the treaty of 1801 ceded half of awadh to the british east india company and also agreed to disband his troops in favor of a hugely expensive britishrun army this treaty effectively made the state of awadh a vassal to the british east india company though it notionally continued to be part of the mughal empire in name until 1819
========
the treaty of 1801 formed an arrangement that was very beneficial to the company they were able to use awadhs vast treasuries repeatedly digging into them for loans at reduced rates in addition the revenues from running awadhs armed forces brought them useful revenues while it acted as a buffer state the nawabs were ceremonial kings busy with pomp and show but with little influence over matters of state by the midnineteenth century however the british had grown impatient with the arrangement and wanted direct control of awadh
========
in 1856 the east india company first moved its troops to the border then annexed the state which was placed under a chief commissioner  sir  henry lawrence   wajid ali shah  the then nawab was imprisoned and then exiled by the company to  calcutta  in the subsequent  revolt of 1857  his 14year old son birjis qadr son of  begum hazrat mahal  was crowned ruler and sir henry lawrence killed in the hostilities following the rebellions defeat begum hazrat mahal and other rebel leaders obtained asylum in  nepal
========

========
those company troops who were recruited from the state along with some of the nobility of the state were major players in the events of 1857 the rebels took control of awadh and it took the british 18 months to reconquer the region months which included the famous  siege of lucknow  oudh was placed back under a chief commissioner and was governed as a british province in 1877 the offices of lieutenantgovernor of the northwestern provinces and chief commissioner of oudh were combined in the same person and in 1902 when the new name of  united provinces of agra and oudh  was introduced the title of chief commissioner was dropped though oudh still retained some marks of its former independence
========
the province of awadh anglicized to oudh was annexed by the east india company in 1856 and placed under the control of a chief commissioner in the  indian rebellion of 1857  also known as the  first war of indian independence  and the indian mutiny the  garrison  based at the  residency  in lucknow was  besieged  by rebel forces the famous siege of lucknow was relieved first by forces under the command of sir  henry havelock  and sir  james outram  followed by a stronger force under sir  colin campbell  today the ruins of the residency and the picturesque shaheed smarak offer reminiscences of lucknows role in the stirring events of 1857
========
the city played an important role in both the first war of independence and the modern indian freedom struggle whether it was the  lucknow pact  of 1916 or the  khilafat movement  it brought the citizens on a united platform against the british rule in the khilafat movement  maulana abdul bari  of  firangi mahal  lucknow actively participated and cooperated  with  mahatama gandhi  and  maulana muhammad ali jauhar
