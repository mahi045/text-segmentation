portauprince    in  english  and    in  french   haitian creole  pòtoprens is the  capital  and largest  city  of  haiti   growth especially in crowded slums in nearby plains and hillsides has raised the population of the portauprince area to between 25 and 3 million it is located on a bay of the  gulf of la gonave  at    the citys layout is somewhat similar to that of an  amphitheatre  commercial districts are near the water while residential neighborhoods are located on the hills above
========
before the arrival of  christopher columbus  the region that would eventually become portauprince was not the site of any permanent human settlement at the end of the  15th century  the region was under the control of an amerindian ruler by the name of  bohechio  and he like his predecessors feared settling too close to the coast  such settlements would have proven to be tempting targets for the  caribes  who lived on neighbouring islands instead the region served as a hunting ground
========
with the arrival of the  spaniards  the amerindians were forced to become a  protectorate  and bohechio childless at death was succeeded by his sister  anacaona  wife of the  cacique  caonabo anacaona tried to maintain cordial relations with the spaniards but this proved to be difficult as the latter came to insist upon larger and larger tributes eventually the spanish colonial administration decided to rule directly and in  1503   nicolas ovando  then governor set about to put an end to the régime headed by anacaona he invited her and other tribal leaders to a feast and when the amerindians had drunk a good deal of  wine   the spaniards did not drink on that occasion  he ordered most of the guests killed anacaona was spared though only to be hanged publicly some time later through violence and disease the spanish settlers decimated the native population
========
direct spanish rule over the area having been established ovando founded a settlement not far from the coast west of  etang saumâtre  ironically named santa maria de la paz verdadera which would be abandoned several years later not long thereafter ovando founded santa maria del puerto the latter was first burned by french explorers in  1535  then again in  1592  by the english these assaults proved to be too much for the spanish colonial administration and in  1606  it decided to abandon the region
========
for more than 50 years the area that is today portauprince saw its population drop off drastically finally some  buccaneers  began to use it as a base and  dutch  merchants began to frequent it in search of  leather  as game was abundant there around  1650  french  pirates  or flibustiers running out of room on the  île de la tortue  began to arrive on the coast and established a colony at  trouborded  as the colony grew they set up a hospital not far from the coast on the  turgeau  heights this led to the region being known as hôpital
========
although there had been no real spanish presence in hôpital for well over 50 years spain retained its formal claim to the territory and the growing presence of the french flibustiers on ostensibly spanish lands provoked the spanish crown to dispatch castilian soldiers to hôpital to retake it the mission proved to be a disaster for the spanish as they were outnumbered and outgunned and in  1697  the spanish government signed the  treaty of ryswick  renouncing any claims to hôpital around this time the french also established bases at ester part of  petiterivière  and  gonaïves
========
ester was a rich village inhabited by merchants and equipped with straight streets it was here that the governor lived on the other hand the surrounding region petiterivière was quite poor following a great fire in  1711  ester was abandoned yet the french presence in the region continued to grow and not long thereafter a new city was founded to the south  léogane
========
while the first french presence in hôpital the region that was later to contain portauprince was that of the flibustiers as the region became a real french colony the colonial administration began to worry about the continual presence of these pirates while useful in repelling englishmen intent on encroaching upon french territory they were relatively independent unresponsive to orders from the colonial administration and a potential threat to it therefore in the winter of  1707   choiseulbeaupré  the governor of the region sought to get rid of what he saw as a threat he insisted upon control of the hospital but the flibustiers refused considering this humiliating they proceeded to close the hospital rather than cede control of it to the governor and many of them became habitans farmers  the first longterm european inhabitants in the region
========
though the elimination of the flibustiers as a group from hôpital reinforced the authority of the colonial administration it also made the region a more attractive target for the english in order to protect the area in 1706 a captain named de saintandré sailed into the bay just below the hospital in a ship named le prince it is said that m de saintandré named the area portauprince meaning port of the le prince although the port and the surrounding region continued to be known as hôpital however the  islets  in the bay had already been known as les îlets du prince as early as 1680
========
the english did not trouble the area and various nobles sought land grants from the french crown in hôpital the first noble to control hôpital was sieur  joseph randot  upon his death in  1737  sieur  pierre morel  gained control over part of the region with  gatien bretton des chapelles  acquiring another portion of it
========
by this time the colonial administration was convinced that a capital needed to be chosen in order better to control the french portion of santodomingo  hispaniola  for a time  petitgoâve  and léogane vied for this honor but both were eventually ruled out for various reasons first of all neither was centrally located petitgoâves climate was too  malarial  and léoganes topography made it difficult to defend thus in  1749  a new city was built portauprince
========
in  1770  portauprince replaced  capfrançais  the modern caphaïtien as capital of the colony of  saintdomingue  and in  1804  it became the capital of newlyindependent haïti before haïtian independence it was captured by  british  troops on  june 4   1794  during the  french  and  haïtian  revolutions it was known as portrépublicain before being renamed portauprince by  jacques i  emperor of haïti when haïti was divided between a kingdom in the north and a republic in the south portauprince was the capital of the republic under the leadership of  alexandre pétion   henri christophe  renamed the city portauxcrimes after the  assassination  of jacques i at  pont larnage  now known as pontrouge and located north of the city
========

portauprince is the nations largest center of economy and finance the city currently exports its most widely consumed produce of  coffee  and  sugar  and has in the past exported other goods such as shoes and baseballs portauprince has foodprocessing plants as well as  soap   textile  and  cement  factories despite political unrest the city also relies on the  tourism  industry and  construction  companies to move its economy portauprince was once a popular place for cruises but has since lost nearly all of its tourism and no longer has cruise ships coming into port
========
though unemployment is very high in portauprince it would be more accurate to say that people are underemployed walking down the streets of portauprince a person cannot help but recognize the extremely high levels of activity especially among people selling goods and services right off the streets in  simon fass s research book political economy in haïti the drama of survival he argues that in fact virtually no one is unemployed in portauprinces slums because they would be unable to survive if they were portauprince has several rather upscale districts in which crime rates are much lower than the center of the capital although the political situation has diverted investors away from the city there is a significant amount of foreign businessmen in the capital they frequently stay in topnotch hotels such as the  wellknown  oloffson

========


the population of the portauprince  metro area  is greater than 2 million the majority of the population is of  black african  descent but a prominent  mulatto  minority controls many of the citys businesses there are sizeable numbers of  hispanic  residents and businessowners as well as small numbers of  whites  mostly foreignborn temporary residents citizens of  middle eastern  particularly syrian and lebanese ancestry are a growing minority with a significant presence in the capital  arab haitians  in which a large number live in the capital are more often than not concentrated in financial areas where the majority of them establish businesses the majority of the citys poorer inhabitants are concentrated in densely populated slums such as la saline located directly north of downtown and west of the middleclass delmas neighborhood belair martissant and the poorest mostdangerous slum  cité soleil  located directly north of la saline in fact the downtown area is nearly completely engulfed in its own slums there are however many comfortable living quarters in the city especially in the southeastern portion of the city around the school of sacred heart and going towards the wealthy upper class suburb of  pétionville  pétionville is known for its plush mansions on the hills overlooking portauprince from the southeast but it too has begun to receive an inundation of migrants from the countryside where farmland is eroding into desert and many people come to the city to search for jobs the government cannot accommodate the flood of migrants into the city hence there are shantytowns erecting even in pétionville as well as in nearby districts like  carrefour  and the financially wealthier when compared to the former district of  delmas  most of the mulattos in the city are concentrated and reside within these wealthier areas of portauprince
========
portauprince over the years has become rather disorderly in its urban planning modernization is gradually countering this however portauprince is subdivided into various districts and neighborhoods there are a ring of districts that radiate out from the center of portauprince pétionville is an affluent suburb under portauprinces jurisdiction located southeast of the city delmas is located directly south of the airport and north of the central city and carrefour which is quite poor especially when compared with the other two suburbs is located southwest of central portauprince downtown portauprince harbors many lowincome slums plagued with poverty and violence in which the most notorious  cité soleil  is situated the champ de mars area has begun some modern infrastructure development as of recently the downtown area is the site of several projected modernization efforts in the capital
========

the current mayor of portauprince is  jean yves jason  the citys separate districts primarily the districts of  delmas   carrefour  and  pétionville  are all administered by their own local mayors who in turn fall under the jurisdiction of the citys general mayor the seat of the state the presidential palace is located in the champ de mars plaza of the city the pndh police nationale dhaïti is the authority governing the enforcement of city laws the national police force as of recently have been increasing in number however because of its ailing ineffectiveness and insufficient manpower a significant number of  un  personnel is present throughout the city as part of the  stabilization mission in haiti
