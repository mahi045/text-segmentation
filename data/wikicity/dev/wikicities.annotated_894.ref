prior to its establishment the area occupied by sapporo known as the ishikari plain was home to a number of indigenous  ainu  settlements in 1866 at the end of the  edo period  construction began on a canal through the area encouraging a number of early settlers to establish sapporo village the settlements name was taken from the ainu language and can be translated as large river running through a plain
