despite its advantageous location and its heritage until recently izmir has suffered as one author puts it from a sketchy understanding in the eyes of outsiders when the  ottomans  took over izmir in the 15th century they did not inherit compelling historical memories unlike the two other keys of the trade network namely  istanbul  and  aleppo  its emergence as a major international port as of the 17th century was largely a result of the attraction it exercised over foreigners and the citys european orientation  very different people found izmir attractive over the ages and the city has always been governed by fresh inspirations including for the very location of its center and is quick to adopt novelties and projects nevertheless its successful completion of the 2005  universiade  games gave its inhabitants a renewed confidence in themselves which remains very present in the bid made for  universal expo  2015
