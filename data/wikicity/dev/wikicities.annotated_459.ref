========
the name colombo first introduced by the portuguese in 1505 is believed to be derived from the classical  sinhalese  name kolon thota meaning port on the river  kelani  it has also been suggested that the name may be derived from the sinhalese name kolaambathota which means harbor with leafy mango trees

due to its large  natural harbour  and its strategic position along the  eastwest  sea  trade routes  colombo was known to ancient traders 2000 years ago however it was only made the capital of the island when sri lanka was ceded to the  british empire  in 1815  and its status as capital was retained when the nation received  independence  in 1948 in 1978 when administrative functions were moved to  sri jayawardenepura kotte  colombo was designated as the commercial capital of sri lanka

like many cities colombos urban area extends well beyond the boundaries of a single local authority encompassing other  municipal  and urban councils the main city is home to a majority of the sri lankas corporate offices restaurants and entertainment venues

as colombo possesses a natural harbor it was known to  romans   arabs  and  chinese  traders over 2000 years ago traveler  ibn batuta  who visited the island in the 14th century referred to it as kalanpu arabian  muslims  whose prime interests were trade began to settle in colombo around the 8th century ce mostly because the port helped their business and controlled much of the trade between the  sinhalese  kingdoms and the outside world they now comprise the local  sri lankan moor  community

 portuguese  explorers led by don  lourenço de almeida  first arrived in sri lanka in 1505 during their initial visit they made a treaty with the king of kotte parakramabahu viii 14841508 enabling them to trade in the islands crop of cinnamon which lay along the coastal areas of the island including in colombo
========
the portuguese soon realized that control of sri lanka was necessary for protection of their coastal establishments in india and they began to manipulate the rulers of the kotte kingdom in order to gain control of the area after skilfully exploiting rivalries within the royal family they took control of a large area of the kingdom and the sinhalese king mayadunne established a new kingdom at sitavaka a domain in the kotte kingdom

this part of colombo is still known as fort and houses the presidential palace and the majority of colombos  five star  hotels the area immediately outside fort is known as pettah sinhala piṭa koṭuva outer fort and is a commercial hub

========
although the  british  captured colombo in 1796 it remained a  british military  outpost until the kandyan kingdom was ceded to them in 1815 and they made colombo the capital of their newly created  crown colony  of  ceylon  unlike the portuguese and dutch before them whose primary use of colombo was as a military fort the british began constructing houses and other civilian structures around the fort giving rise to the current city of colombo

initially they placed the administration of the city under a collector and john macdowell of the  madras  service was the first to hold the office then in 1833 the  government agent  of the western province was charged with the administration of the city centuries of  colonial rule  had meant a decline of indigenous administration of colombo and in 1865 the british conceived a municipal council as a means of training the local population in  selfgovernance  the  legislative council of ceylon  constituted the colombo municipal council in 1865 and the council met for the first time on the january 16 1866 at the time the population of the region was around 80000
========
during the time they were in control of the colombo the british were responsible for much of the planning of the present city in some parts of the city  tram  car tracks and granite flooring laid during the era are still visible today
========
this era of colonialism ended peacefully in 1948 when ceylon gained independence from britain due to the tremendous impact this caused on the citys inhabitants and on the country as a whole the changes that resulted at the end of the colonial period were drastic an entire new culture took root changes in laws and customs clothing styles religions and  proper names  were a significant result of the colonial era
